1n76xpo,Best Passive Income Ideas | Sept 2025,"September is here.﻿ ﻿Summer is officially over but I'm excited to get back to the grind. Let's go!

How do you slowly but surely succeed? Don’t be like everyone else. Position yourself to buy or build income-generating assets. [Be smart. Be consistent](https://x.com/APompliano/status/1953575138848649458).

Below are the best passive income ideas and content from the past month.

**In This Issue:**

﻿﻿﻿﻿**🎯 **[**From Tiny Niche to $3k/mo Etsy Shop**](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1mp9kdt/the_tiny_niche_that_felt_too_small_but_now_makes/)  
*“Now I wasn’t just selling a product, I was fixing a problem people actually had.”*  
Material‑Escape1057’s Etsy store floundered when they tried to serve everyone; once they sorted their ideas into three buckets—hobbies, life events, and pain points—they discovered that ultra‑specific niches win.

﻿﻿﻿﻿**🧵 **[**Path to a Successful Etsy Shop**](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1muyh0o/took_me_4_months_to_get_my_first_sale_on_etsy_now/)  
*“I never gave up though and now I’m at the point where I'm making consistent sales.”*  
Another Etsy success story. LootManVan documented the grind of getting an Etsy store off the ground which didn’t work at first, but after methodical and disciplined adjustments, got it to $2.3k/mo. Some advice he has are: price for profit, use tools (like [Pinterest Trends](https://trends.pinterest.com/)), track your conversion rate, reinvest in your best sellers, etc.

﻿﻿﻿﻿**🖥️ **[**Building Websites to Generate Hosting Income**](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1musqp5/2kmonth_in_passive_income_just_maintaining/)  
*“If you know basic WordPress or web hosting, this is one of the most underrated side hustles out there.”*  
Tried and true for a reason. Find local small businesses that need a website. Build it for them and charge them a monthly hosting fee. This person did it and now makes $2k/mo in passive income. *\[Author note: I’ve actually done this before. You will get requests from customers from time to time so you have to be very clear in the original agreement what is included in the monthly fee and what costs extra (changing logos, doing SEO, etc).\]*

﻿﻿﻿﻿**⚙️** [**Don’t Sleep on Cloning**](https://www.tiktok.com/@diaryofpodcast/video/7542177829618847006)  
*“Two of the greatest cloners in human history were Bill Gates and Sam Walton.”*  
You can apply this to a lot of passive income methods. Clone really successful YouTube channels. Clone awesome web tools. Clone great digital products. Obviously, don’t outright copy them - but cloning what works is a legitimate shortcut to success.

﻿﻿﻿﻿**🔄 **[**Don’t Give Up - Journey to $52M**](https://www.tiktok.com/@marshallhaas/video/7541737557516717342)  
*“Stay in the game, parlay your wins, and keep building.”*  
One entrepreneur’s journey filled with many many failures and blips of success, eventually ending up in a massive exit. Not totally passive income but I love his message about building and staying in the game - which can ultimately lead to solid passive income.

﻿**🚧** [**Sticker Marketing - Creative & Effective**](https://www.tiktok.com/@wizardryanchute/video/7539563529746025746)  
*“We got those stickers for less than a buck a piece.”*  
This company sent out stickers with instructions about shutting off water tanks - no immediate pay off, but when things broke - who did the customers call? They generated $67k with this. *\[Author note: What a creative way to plant marketing seeds for long-term payoff. Hope this inspires you to think of ways you can provide value to the customer which can then drive traffic/calls to your business.\]*

**🔥 Quick Hits:**

• [**Cool Vending Machine**](https://www.tiktok.com/@overtime/video/7538285991363153166) \- I love fun vending machines that draw people in.  
• [**Short Form Video Guide**](https://www.tiktok.com/@jun_yuh/video/7536415154293067022) \- Quick video on where to put your eyes, text, etc and what areas to avoid in your short-form video (Tiktok, Reels, etc).  
• [**Making Money with Keyboard Demo Mode**](https://www.tiktok.com/@tomsimmermaker/video/7527152808789839117) \- Not passive income really and likely not real but hilarious.  
• [**60% Return from Savings Accounts**](https://x.com/BoringBiz_/status/1961445891341975570) \- Another funny one. Obviously not serious.

Ok, that's it for this month. I hope you’re well. Don't give up. It's all possible. You can do it.

So, now I am earning money from [my AI Course](https://www.rajamanickam.com/l/LearnAI). It is not fully passive.

1j9vn94,Mod Team Vetted: Rent Out Websites for Passive Income [Updated],"Updated: They added an additional explainer video on their site, alongside a new case study about Stephanie, a woman who joined their program 10 months ago who’s now at $7,800/month in reoccuring income.

*TLDR:* [Not Another Coaching Program](https://notanothercoachingprogram.com/) *- a coaching program that costs $2,980 and will teach you how to rent little websites for extra money passively AFTER some upfront work.* 

*After several Zoom calls trying to poke holes in their business model, I think this is a damn-good way to add small, reliable, recurring income streams to whatever you’ve got going on currently.* 

*The core engine of it is SEO so I was very curious as I’ve done SEM/SEO for 20+ years. I’ve never fully endorsed a program on this sub I created 12 years ago until now. The program is legit and the methodology is sound. I saw their private community and it’s active with lots of rich discussions. This is actually a GREAT program most people can succeed at. The only caveat I would give is if you just aren’t good with the Internet (like you have trouble setting up your gmail or a facebook page) this might be tough for you.*

*For everyone else, here’s their pitch…*   
\--

Hey, it’s Shiv and Kyle from [NotAnotherCoachingProgram.com](https://notanothercoachingprogram.com/). 

Let’s get the bad stuff out of the way: 

• This course costs $2,980, lifetime access. I realize you might not have that much; or maybe you’d saw off your own arm before dropping that kinda cash on a coaching program. I get it. Feel free to bounce now so I don’t waste your time. 

• We teach you how to build, rank, and rent out itty-bitty websites to small businesses wanting more customers. Aka, local SEO. Not new. Not sexy. But tried and true. 

• Why teach? Because the money is great, obviously. But also, there’s endless niche/city combo’s, and a community means more help ranking sites and closing deals. 

• Downsides? There’s a few. It’s not instant money. SEO takes time (Maybe 2-6 Months). Also, some business owners may not see the value or can’t handle more leads. Some are just annoying to deal with. Others will stop paying after a few months, for whatever reason. Overall, though, it’s still pretty awesome. 

• Each site has overhead of about $20-$30 per month. But the lowest we typically rent the sites out for is $500 per month. Pretty solid ROI. 

Assuming I haven’t scared you off yet, let’s go through some FAQs. 

**How does this work?** 

1- Pick an easy local niche to get leads for. “Spray Foam Insulation Carlsbad, California,” for example. 

2- Make a small, simple website and optimize it for relevant search terms.

3- Get it ranked in Google, Bing, Apple Maps, and AI tools like ChatGPT.

4- Add a local phone number that can track and forward every call that comes in. 

5- Hit up some Spray Foam Insulation companies in Carlsbad (to stick with this hypothetical example) and offer them free leads for a week. When someone agrees, route the leads to them. We or some of our hungry students can do the outreach for you if it’s not your thing. 

6- After a week of the free leads doing all the selling for you, tell them, “It’ll be $850/month to keep ‘em coming.” Or whatever our custom pricing tool says is fair for that niche and city. Yes, we can close them, too, if that part sounds too scary (It’s not). But, it will cost you. 

7- This is when it becomes truly passive because the site is ranked, the phone number is auto-forwarding to your client and all you have to do after that is run their credit card every month. If you priced the site right, you’ll never have to speak with your client again because they’ll forget they’re even paying you. 

8- Now rinse and repeat.

**Hmm. Are you sure this is legit?** 

Well, put it this way: 

Uber, Airbnb, Alibaba, Angi, House, Zillow, Thumbtack, and [Apartments.com](http://Apartments.com) all use the same model. 

Connect buyer with seller, take a sliver to deliver. We just do it on a granular level. So yeah. Not only is it legitimate, it’s actually kinda brilliant. 

**Who’s this for?** 

Anyone, anywhere, any background, as long as you have some ambition, grit, and of course, basic computer skills. NO CODING INVOLVED. 

We use drag and drop website builders like Weebly & Site Panda so zero previous web design experience is needed. 

The more time you can devote to it, the better. But if you’re not in a rush, take your time and build up your digital real estate empire over time. 

Everything’s done online - So no, you do not have to do this in your own city. Nor do you have to meet anyone in person - unless you want to. 

**How much does the course cost?**

Like I said, our coaching program is $2,980 - Lifetime Access to the course material and private Facebook Group. 

Then, to run the business, you’re looking at less than $30 per month per website. (Which covers your domain, hosting, local tracking number, and research software.) 

Chump change considering the potential. 

**How much does an average site make?** 

$600/month is a safe estimate. 

Most of ours do $1,000 to $2,000/month. Sometimes more. 

**Yeah, but, for how long?** 

For as long as you own the site. 

No different than renting out houses or apartments, right? 

And if someone stops paying, same thing - you just find a new “tenant.” 

Click a few buttons, reroute the leads to them, keep collecting checks. 

Dead serious… 

I made a site 5 years ago that’s been paying me $1,000 a month the entire time. That’s $60,000 and counting! 

You could hand these off to your kids one day. 

**How much work is involved?** 

A good amount in the beginning and then hardly any once the website is built, ranked, and you’ve partnered with a business. 

You could make a site in a day. 

Then ask others in our group for some backlinks (which are like votes in the SEO process). 

From there, it’ll take a few weeks to a few months to jump to page 1, depending on your niche and city. 

In the meantime, go make more.

Soon, you’ll have emails and calls trickling in. 

Leverage those leads to close a deal… and then it’s basically mailbox money from there. Okay, how soon will I make money with this? 

Anywhere from one month to six months after starting, depending on a number of factors like: 

1- How well you selected your niche & city. We prefer low-hanging fruit - the search terms with very weak SEO competition. 

2- Your ability to trust the process, not overcomplicate things and just follow the exact steps taught. 

3- How willing you are to reach out to business owners to offer them free leads and then ask for money. 

From there, it’s just focus, execution, and consistency. 

If you do your part, no reason you can’t have a handful of websites generating leads within the first month. 

And then you start landing clients in month two… 

And by month three? You’ve got a G-Wagon parked outside your new mansion, and you hardly ever run into your live-in servants, which is nice. 

(I’m joking.) 

**How many of these can I have?** 

As many as you can comfortably manage. 

No business is infinitely scalable though. Eventually you’ll need a team to go bigger and bigger. Anything below 20 clients is 98% passive. But 20 clients is easily $15k to $25k a month. 

As you grow to 40 and 50 clients, you’ll have some credit cards that decline that you have to follow up with and you have higher odds of needy clients who want to ask you questions. 

But this is something you can do as a one-person operation and easily get to 10, 20, maybe 30 rental sites with minimal maintenance if any at all.

**Don’t most businesses already have a website?** 

Yes, and if they happen to be at the top of the search results, they probably don’t need us. But for the vast majority, who’re buried back on page 4 of Google, it’s a different story. Their website is a digital dust collector. 

Whereas, yours? Will be a cash factory churning out profits… that’ll make the amount they’re paying you seem like pennies in a wishing well. 

Plus, you can structure deals to remove risk. 

So instead of a flat monthly fee, they could pay you $5 per phone call or 10% of booked business that comes through your site, for instance. 

Boom. How can they lose? 

**Wait, why wouldn’t they just do this themselves?** 

Most simply don’t have the time, energy, or inclination to nerd-out on this stuff, even if it is a game-changer for their business. 

And remember, for every dollar they throw your way, they’re making that back several times over. 

So most of ‘em are more than cool with it. 

**Won’t it get saturated if you tell everyone?** 

Not gonna be an issue. 

Why? 

Because you would have to multiply every type of local business by every city on this big blue planet - and then go do this in however many millions of niches that would be - before you could say it’s cooked. 

And we’re a looong ways from that. 

**Why do I need a course? Can’t I figure this out myself?**

Sure, anyone can figure anything out on their own with the internet. But you’ll be banging your head against the wall for a year and most people don’t have that type of stamina before making a single dollar. 

We lay out the exact step by step process that we have used over and over again. Our repeat student successes within 6 months reassures us that we have our training nailed down. 

**Are there any renewal fees or mandatory purchases from us?** 

No further purchases from our program are required, but we do offer some outsourcing services:

1 - If you want our team to build you a fully optimized site, that’ll run ya $300 per site. 

2 - If you want to use our proprietary software to build your site, that’ll run you a $25 platform fee plus $7.50 fee per site per month. 

3 - If you want to use our proprietary phone software, depending on usage, that’ll run you \~$7.50 per month per number. 

Let’s be clear though, if you want to use another website builder or other phone number service, be our guest. It won’t hurt you at all. 

**Fine. Can I see some examples?** 

Thought you’d never ask.

1nkmhiq,Best way to make passive income is launch your own micro saas - Here is my playbook to get from 0 to $10K MRR,"Everyone wants “passive income” but let’s be real - dropshipping, ebooks, even affiliate links die fast.   
  
Micro SaaS is the only real play left.   
  
Why? Because code runs 24/7, solves a pain, and scales without you being online all day.

Here’s the playbook I followed to take micro SaaS ideas from 0 → $10K MRR:

**Step 1: Find the Pain**

* Don’t overthink. Look for things people complain about every day on Reddit, X, or in FB groups.
* If you’ve built even one side project, chances are you already solved something worth charging for.
* Rule of thumb: if 10 people have hacked a Notion template or Google Sheet to solve it, it’s ripe for SaaS.

**Step 2: Build Stupid Simple**

* No bloated features. One workflow, one outcome, one wow moment.
* Make the MVP in 2-3 weeks. Forget pixel-perfect design, ship ugly but working.
* Automate your manual solution → wrap it in a SaaS → charge.

**Step 3: Launch Like a Maniac**

* Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, Betalist, Peerlist, Hacker News (Show HN).
* Post to SaaS, SideProject, EntrepreneurRideAlong etc communities 
* Microlaunch, Uneed, Startup directories (200+ if you’re serious).
* Build in public: tweet progress, share screenshots, even mistakes. People buy transparency.

**Step 4: Get Early Users**

* Manually DM and onboard 10–20 people who cry about your problem.
* Offer lifetime deals for early feedback.
* Do customer support yourself. Every chat is gold.

**Step 5: Growth Loops, not Hacks**

* Make your users invite others (referrals, credits, team seats).
* Turn FAQs → blog posts, “competitor alternatives” → SEO pages, templates → traffic machines.
* Focus on retention first. New signups mean nothing if they churn.

**Step 6: Scale to $10K MRR**

* Double down on the channel that works. If Twitter threads bring 5 customers, write 50.
* Track ONE metric: MRR. Ignore vanity fluff.
* Keep improving 5% per week. Compounds like crazy.

Passive income isn’t “set it and forget it.” It’s **ship once, improve forever, automate everything**.

1nl3zeq,Why Franchises Succeed and Failed: What Every Entrepreneur Should Know,"Franchising is often seen as the “safe route” into business ownership, but let’s be real, it’s not always smooth sailing. I’ve seen people absolutely thrive in franchises, and I’ve also seen others struggle and walk away frustrated.

So why the difference? A few key things usually make or break it:

✅ Support system – The best franchises give you strong training, marketing, and operational support. The weaker ones leave you to figure things out on your own.  
✅ Fit with your lifestyle & goals – Some people want flexibility, others want structure. If the franchise model doesn’t match your personal goals, you’ll feel stuck.  
✅ Location & market demand – Even the strongest brand can struggle in the wrong market.  
✅ Mindset – At the end of the day, a franchise isn’t “buying success.” It’s still a business, and it needs hard work, leadership, and consistency.

If you’re thinking of jumping in, it’s not just about the brand name. It’s about the alignment between you, the franchise system, and the market you’re in.

What’s your take? Do you think franchises are more of a safety net, or just another risky business dressed up with a logo?

• 100k operations every month  
• 2 workspaces  
• API access  
• Built-in Airtable-like database (10k records included)

Affiliate marketing doesn’t need a website or ad budget to get started. What works for me is keeping it simple:

* Find affiliate programs with real demand (VPNs, fitness gear, productivity tools, etc.).
* Share value in communities where people are already asking for product recommendations.
* Never spam links, focus on creating posts that sound like genuine advice or reviews.
* Consistency matters more than anything. Posting once won’t work, but a steady rhythm compounds.

This method has brought me $500+ days on multiple occasions. It’s not instant, but once you learn how to position affiliate offers the right way, it scales really well.

1nkwt25,Recommendation for good affiliate programs,"I’m thinking of creating a website to promote products using affiliate links. I’ve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I’ll write a few words about each so you understand why I’m asking here. :)

Rakuten:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn’t even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn’t started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it’s a horror story. I’m amazed they’re still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that’s a no, I don’t want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

Temu:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

Amazon Associates:

You’d think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon’s growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I’ve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn’t count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I’m pretty disappointed, and it seems like it’s not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren’t good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days — not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

Don’t randomly close your account with money in it for no reason

Basically, just some decency and respect for the time you put into promoting their products, nothing more.",HappyInstruction2578,2,3,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1nl3d30,is this business idea actually legit to make passive income as a 20yo with student debt:,"i recently ask this subreddit for ideas to make passive income as a 20yo with ai and automation and i just received an interesting answer to my post don't know if it's doable so curious to get everyones thoughts on the matter:

""there's a way to make money with AI no one is talking about and it's making me go insane (i am running 2 6-figure businesses and don't have the mental bandwith currently to build another one). so here's the idea:

everyone's focused on automation but missed the actual money maker which is ai video production services. like actual professional grade stuff not the garbage you see on tiktok. agencies are still quoting 50-100k for launch videos and most businesses can't afford that. but you can deliver 90% of the quality for under 2k and pocket the difference.

the workflow is stupid simple once you get it down. you write scripts like normal then use midjourney for hero shots (11 bucks a month). generate cinematic stills of key moments, focus on close ups for face swapping. then you use fal ai ideogram character for face consistency, create masks manually and upscale with enhancor for skin texture. then for the actual video generation you use argil ai wich is the only tool that keeps face and voice consistent across clips. you record client's voice samples, generate 8 second clips with specific prompting, burns through credits but that's why you charge 2k instead of 100k.

post production is still traditional, elevenlabs for music and sound effects, edit in premiere, color correct and sound mix like always. you can show clients exactly what the final looks like before they pay. location scouting is dead, any environment costs 10 bucks in credits. client can be the talent, reshoots are just prompt changes.

i've seen people charging 1500-3000 per video and delivering in a week instead of months. the bottleneck isn't the tech anymore it's finding clients who understand they're getting 90% of hollywood quality for 5% of the price. b2b saas companies, e commerce brands, personal brands, they all need this stuff and most don't even know it's possible yet.

the learning curve is maybe 2-3 months to get good at prompting and workflow but once you nail it you're printing money. way better than tiktok automation which is a race to the bottom. this actually requires skill so there's a moat.

only reason i'm not doing this myself is bandwidth but someone's gonna figure this out soon and make bank. might as well be you since you're starting from zero anyway and have the time to learn the tools properly.""",The-GTM-engineer,0,8,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1nkypq5,Data on why affiliate marketers are losing 10-14% of passive income (tracking issues),"I've been researching affiliate link management issues and found some concerning data that affects anyone building passive income through affiliates:

• 10-14% of conversions are lost due to tracking failures

• Almost half of affiliate marketers say unreliable tracking is their biggest challenge

• People managing 15+ affiliate programs waste hours weekly on manual link organization

• iOS updates and privacy changes are breaking traditional tracking methods

The most shocking case I found: Someone with 650+ clicks showing 0 conversions in Amazon Associates after 2 days - turned out to be a tracking parameter issue.

Has anyone here experienced similar issues with your affiliate passive income streams? Curious if these numbers align with what you're seeing, especially with recent browser privacy updates.

1nkjv35,"How I built a consistent $20/day income stream (no surveys, no gimmicks)","After months of trying surveys, gig apps, and flipping schemes that barely moved the needle, I finally cracked a simple system that generates $20-30 daily.

The method is: Content/digital products

I find trending topics in profitable niches (finance, health, tech), create quick 5-minute videos or posts about them, The key is targeting micro-niches where competition is low but interest is high.

My Daily Process:

* 30 minutes: Research trending topics using free tools
* 45 minutes: Create content (I use simple screen recordings or text posts)
* 15 minutes: Post across 3-4 platforms
* The rest runs on autopilot

Why This will Work for you:

* No upfront investment needed
* Works with any schedule (I batch content on weekends)
* Scales naturally (some days I hit $40-50)
* Platform-agnostic (works on Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)

1nkleq5,New to Sellfy: how do you get customers and stand out?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve recently started selling digital products (compliance/cybersecurity assessment tools) on Sellfy, and I’m looking to step up my marketing game.

I’d love to hear from people who’ve successfully driven traffic to their Sellfy (or similar platforms like Gumroad, Etsy digital, etc.) stores:
	•	What strategies have worked best for you in bringing in consistent sales? (SEO, social media, content marketing, paid ads, influencer outreach, etc.)
	•	Any clever tips and tricks for standing out in what feels like a crowded digital marketplace?
	•	What automation tools or platforms do you use to make the process easier? (e.g., scheduling posts, email sequences, analytics dashboards, etc.)
	•	If you were starting over today, what’s one thing you’d focus on first to get traction?

I’m hoping this thread can become a bit of a “best practices” list for anyone selling digital products on Sellfy.

I’m still waiting to find a free course that can teach me programming or web development properly, because I want to eventually use those skills to work and support myself.
‎
‎Here’s my situation, I want to move out as soon as I graduate. To do that, I need savings. Based on my research, I’ll probably need around PKR 200,000–250,000 (about $700-900) to survive for 5-6 months in Islamabad while I look for a job and get on my feet. I have about 15 months realistically to save this.
‎
‎I’ve tried a lot of things to earn money  art commissions, TikTok, Fiverr  but none of them worked out for me. I’m still searching for any kind of work I can do quietly and consistently that will help me reach this savings goal before graduation.
‎
‎My questions are:
‎
‎What are realistic ways I can earn and save this amount in the next 15 months?
‎
‎If you’ve moved out on your own, what are the things I need to be aware of when starting out?
‎
‎What should be my first priorities when I finally move?

1nk3jzp,"I've created courses that have generated over $7000 in revenue, despite spending less than 2 hours a day working. AMA!","Hey guys, I'll keep this short and sweet, and hopefully many of you find this useful. I'd like to spend some time to answer any questions you may have about succeeding with course authoring.

To put it into perspective, there are over 1,3 million e-learning products on Gumroad. Based on the number of products compared to the median revenue of around $70 for each product, If you want to stand a chance at a creating a successful e-learning product, you need to spend less time on the base content (curriculum, structure, researching and drafting) and more time making your course have a genuine impact on the learner.

[Here is proof of my Gumroad revenue](https://imgur.com/a/lRbwznP)

How to impact the learner?

**Actually, making a product that generates revenue is easy when you have enough time to create the difference that makes your product hold more value than others.** Yet, it is difficult to get the basic down and start creating value.

Here is how to add value to your course, beyond the content:

Most people buy a course to achieve a specific goal, to add value you need to help them reach this goal as fast as possible. This can be done by creating media (infographics, video walkthroughs etc.) and interactive elements (worksheets, checklists, exercises etc.) on top of the standard course content. Also authors should create communities and spend time with learners to gain feedback and improve further products. Your course will never be perfect, but it should be better than the last.

That was the secret to my success with course creation.

1nkfni4,Anyone here ever heard of FreedomPath? (Financial services & biz opportunity),"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something I recently got involved in and see if anyone else has experience with it. It’s called FreedomPath — basically a platform that combines financial services (credit repair, funding options, protection plans, etc.) with a business opportunity.

The main appeal for me was:
	•	They help with credit restoration and funding, which a lot of people need right now.

1nkexc6,From Frustration to Freedom: How I Automated My Way to Passive Income with AI,"hey!

I've been seeing in this community countless posts about the struggle to create passive income streams. I totally get it, because I've been there myself. Me personally I spent months building digital products that no one wanted, and the feeling of failure was constant. I decided I had to make a radical change in my strategy.

Instead of just guessing, I built my own tool: TrendScope, an AI-powered software designed to find winning digital products in real-time on platforms like Etsy and Gumroad. I started using it, and the shift was instant and mind-blowing.

In less than a week, I identified a product idea that was about to go viral. I created the product, and the results exceeded all my expectations. I made my first sale in just a few days, and before the week was over, I had already generated **over $150 from a single product**. That's when I realized I had found the key.

Now, I'm no longer guessing. **I'm using data to make smart decisions**. This tool has allowed me to automate the hardest part of creating digital products: finding ideas that actually work.

I'm not here to sell you anything, but to share my experience and get your feedback. I want you to see the real potential of combining technology with hard work.

If you're interested in seeing how I did it, you can join the waitlist of my project here: [https://whop.com/trendscope](https://whop.com/trendscope).

I'm happy to answer any questions about my journey and what I've learned along the way.

1nkdq3b,"How can I realistically save up in the next 15 months before graduation to move out and live independently, as a female who completed her two years of uni and two academic years are still to go?","‎I study in a very local university where most teachers don’t even show up, and there’s little to no real management. Because of this, I haven’t been able to learn much there. I’ve tried learning online, but I often get overwhelmed by the amount of material and things I can’t understand. I’m still waiting to find a free course that can teach me programming or web development properly, because I want to eventually use those skills to work and support myself.
‎
‎Here’s my situation, I want to move out as soon as I graduate. To do that, I need savings. Based on my research, I’ll probably need around PKR 200,000–250,000 (about $700-900) to survive for 5-6 months in Islamabad while I look for a job and get on my feet. I have about 15 months realistically to save this.
‎
‎I’ve tried a lot of things to earn money  art commissions, TikTok, Fiverr  but none of them worked out for me. I’m still searching for any kind of work I can do quietly and consistently that will help me reach this savings goal before graduation.
‎
‎My questions are:
‎
‎What are realistic ways I can earn and save this amount in the next 15 months?
‎
‎If you’ve moved out on your own, what are the things I need to be aware of when starting out?
‎
‎What should be my first priorities when I finally move?
‎
‎
‎Any advice, especially from people who have been in similar situations or from Pakistan, would mean a lot. I really want to make this happen and live independently after graduation.

1nk88gm,How to sell digital products on Etsy - a Step-by-Step guide,"I see so many people struggling to start their first online store, and I get it. There are a lot of fears before you begin because we always overthink. It's normal!

The first thing you need to tell yourself is that you are good enough for this. I know that making a good income is possible because I went through it myself. This isn't a guide to making millions overnight; it's a real, step-by-step plan to get your first sales.

Let's just start from the beginning:

**1 - Find Your Niche**

Forget ""what skills do I have?"" Start by asking these questions instead:

\- What topics am I genuinely excited about? Your passion is your fuel

\- What unique experience do I have that can solve a real problem for other people?

\- What's a community I'm a part of and understand?

Your goal is to find an area where your interest and a real customer problem overlap

**2 - Do Smart Research** 

Once you have a general idea, it's time to do some research. Go on Etsy and look at your competitors. Ask yourself:

\- What are the bestsellers doing right?

\- What could I do better? Could I make a more interesting design? Serve a more specific audience? Bundle items into a complete kit?

Don't start in niches where products are sold for $1. After Etsy's fees and ads, you'll be left with nothing. Make sure there's room for healthy profit.

**Your Secret Weapon:** Read your competitors' reviews. People often say, ""Everything is good, but I wish it also had..."" That ""but"" is your starting point. If you see a pattern in those comments, you've found gold.

**3 - Create the Product (Solve the Problem)**

Now it's time to make your thing. Use all the information you just gathered in the first two steps. You now have a ton of info to start your product. Search for inspiration on Etsy or Pinterest, but create your product with the research you found in mind.

My main advice here is simple: **don't spend money you don't have to.** You don't need the Pro version of every app right away. If you have a problem, Google it or search for a solution on YouTube. Every product's path is different, but the key is to learn along the way.

**4 - The Preview is 90% of the Sale**

Forget the long description. **People don't read it.** All the critical information about your product must be in your preview images (your mockups).

Analyze the bestsellers in your niche. Don't copy them, but analyze them. What color palettes are they using? Are they using photos or mockups? How much text is on the main image?

Your preview images must answer every question a customer might have before they even think to ask it.

**5 - The Perfect Listing**

When you upload your listing, don’t forget about SEO:

**Title:** Use all 140 characters.

**Tags:** Use all 13 tags.

**Keywords:** Use eRank and read your competitors' reviews to see how real people describe these products. Use those words

**6 - The Final Push**

I personally use Etsy Ads for every new listing.

\- Start with a small budget ($1-3/day)**.** Your goal isn't to get rich from ads; it's to get your first few sales and teach the Etsy algorithm that your listing is a winner.

\- Check your ranking: To see where your listing really is in the search results, always use a **private/incognito browser window.** This shows you what a real customer sees, not what the algorithm thinks you want to see.

\- If your listing is high in the search and you're getting views but no sales, something is wrong with your previews or your price. If you have passion and followed these steps, you should expect your first sales within a few days.

But the most important part is this: **You don't need to spend months on every step. Don't wait for the right moment**

You will learn as you go. Even if you do something wrong, it's just a great experience that will make your next product better. Your goal isn't to be perfect, it's to get your product out there

fails:

\- i realised the importance of isolating advertising experiments like many books say - kinda spammed a lot of platforms so i don't know how to sort out which ad strategy worked (in terms of actually getting people to respond, and also which ones only attract scammers lol)

next:

1nk3gc1,The EASIEST Business Model No One Taught Us (Nano Banana for Local Marketing),"Hi,

I want to show you something cool here. Or I think it is cool. I hope you will think this is grat aswell.

# The Business Model: Elevated Auto Imagery

The auto industry should have a simple premise: a great photo sells a car faster. For a lot of car dealerships and private sellers, this is a major blind spot. They post subpar images that hurt their sales and credibility. You can solve that problem by using the Nano Banana technology to transform their photos. 

You're not just selling a service; You're selling a professional brand presence and a faster sales cycle.

# How It Works:

Your core service is a digital makeover for vehicle images. You take existing photos and use our technology to fix bad lighting, remove distracting backgrounds, and sharpen key details like the paint and wheels. The goal is to make every car look its absolute best online.

The pricing is straightforward and designed for volume. You charge $20-$30 per image as a starting point. A single person can easily handle 20-25 photos a day, which can realistically generate $500 in daily revenue. The low cost and immediate, high-quality results make it an easy decision for our clients.

Later on you can charge higher prices.

# Strategy for Getting Clients:

We don't wait for business to come to us. We go out and find it. Our strategy is highly targeted:

1. Search online directories like the Yellow Pages and Google Maps for local dealerships and private sellers.
2. Visit their websites and look for listings with poor-quality photos.
3. Gather their contact information and use a tool like Postaga to streamline our email outreach. This ensures our communication is consistent and professional.

To show them what you can do, you perform a complimentary enhancement on one of their own photos. You take a dark or cluttered image from their site, apply your process, and send them a side-by-side comparison. The ""before and after"" effect is powerful, and it proves your value without them having to commit to anything.

Here's an example of the kind of low-pressure email we send for this initial contact:

**Subject: Quick question about your recent listing, \[Vehicle Model\]**

Hi \[Name\],

I came across your listing for the \[Vehicle Model\] and was really impressed by your inventory. It's clear you're focused on quality cars.

My name is \[Your Name\], and I specialize in digital imagery for vehicle sales. I've noticed how a car's online presentation can significantly impact how quickly it sells, and I've been doing some research on how to improve that.

I've taken the liberty of doing a quick, complimentary enhancement on one of your photos. I'd love to share it with you and get your thoughts. No strings attached, just a professional curiosity.

Would you be open to me sending that over?

Best regards,

\[Your Name\]



# Why This Business Model Is a Winner:

This model isn't just about a good idea; it's built for success.

1. It solves a real problem. Poor photos cost sellers money. Our service provides a clear, measurable solution that directly impacts their bottom line.
2. Low startup costs. The business is digital. You don't need a physical space or expensive equipment. All you need is a computer, software, and internet access, which allows for high profit margins.
3. It’s scalable. The service can be easily replicated. As business grows, you can hire and train others, turning a one-person operation into a full agency without a huge investment.
4. Targeted and effective outreach. We don't waste time on mass marketing. We find exactly who needs our service and show them exactly why they need it.
5. The ""before and after"" demonstration is a game-changer. It bypasses a traditional sales pitch and lets the results do the talking. Giving a free sample creates trust and shows the client what's possible, making the sale an easy next step.
6. Low-pressure sales. The initial email is designed to build rapport, not push a sale. It's a strategic way to start a conversation and make the client feel valued, which reduces resistance and builds a foundation for a long-term relationship.",Interesting-Beat1672,1,0,[]

1njjk0s,It took my three months to get first sale by selling digital product.But now l make 3.5k$/month and check l make this🔻,"“Most people struggle to make their first online sale not because it’s impossible… but because they overcomplicate it. 🚀
Here’s what I’ve learned works best:

1️⃣ Mindset first – treat it like a business, not a side hustle.

2️⃣ Pick the right niche – look for problems people already want solved.

3️⃣ Analyze demand – if people are asking questions, they’re willing to pay for answers.

4️⃣ Focus on solving one problem – your product doesn’t have to be huge, it just has to help.

That’s the exact formula I used to get my first sales online — and it’s much simpler than people think.

thank you in advance for any feedback given, I will take any criticism as a learning experiment.

Long story short, I want to start a t-shirt business, but my idea is a bit deeper then that (unfortunately I cant go into details about it right now) but what I need advice with is this:

I want to use local people to help me make the t-shirt, like printing, and sawing and other things involved in the project of my (hopefully) new brand. And I also want to use tshirt manufacture locally, not just pick a tshirt that is being mass produced (though many of those tshirts are of very good quality), but I prefer to use local producers.

I worry that perhaps the final cost of using local businesses might be too high, BUT then again, I want my branded shirt to be on the exclusive side, so I wont mind selling them at higher price.

So, what I need help with, is to know if what your opinion might be for this issue?

1njoqjc,I’ve been making income from trading stocks/crypto but I can’t seem to make anything else work,"I’ve worked my ass off at my jobs the past 5 years, but now I’m a housewife and I never want to go back to a full-time job. I make a decent income from trading. Most of my gains come from investments, but I’ve improved a lot at actual trading over the past year. I swing trade stocks and crypto and sell options. So far this year, I’ve made about $12k, which averages around $1400 per month in realized profit, and I’m steadily getting better. My investments have also tripled over the last five years but the profit is not realized since I’ve been holding. 

Even though trading is going well, I’ve always wanted to build other sources of income, but nothing has really stuck. I tried eBay, but the fees are high and it’s difficult to consistently find items people want. My husband and I flip cars, but it takes too much time and comes with a lot of risk. I also tried TikTok and tried 6 different niches. Only one idea gained some traction, but once I had a decent video perform well, the rest didn’t pick up no matter how much effort I put in. I’m going to continue trying with TikTok, but I know consistent content creation takes time before it starts paying off. I experimented with Shopify and building my own website, but the process of designing and managing it was overwhelming and not something I would enjoy at all.

What I really want is to do something online. Staying faceless is non-negotiable if I pursue online. Ideally, I would love to make faceless content creation work, that would be a dream. But I am open to other options, whether that’s YouTube, Etsy, eBay, or some type of service. It doesn’t have to be online like I’d be open to trying out vending machines or something. My advantage is that I do have some money I can invest into something new if the idea makes sense. I just feel like there is so much potential especially with AI.

1njr13k,Is Real Passive Income in Crypto Still Possible?,"Every time i scroll through discussions about passive income, there is always debate around whether crypto still offers any real opportunities or if everything has become either too risky or too small to matter. Back in the early days, staking or lending stablecoins could give double digit returns with almost no effort. Now, most of those yields have dried up, and people are left asking is passive income in crypto even a thing anymore?

I think the answer depends on how you define real. If you are looking for something that requires no effort and no risk, then no, crypto has past that stage. But if you are okay with structured opportunities that carry some level of risk/reward balance, then yes, there are still ways. Things like liquid staking, validator delegation, and token launch events are evolving to fill that gap.

Take for example ongoing events like Bitget’s $PORTAL CandyBomb. It is not the same as a guaranteed yield farm, but it shows how exchanges and platforms are creating structured ways to earn or access tokens by simply holding or participating in specific programs. For some people, that is a form of passive income, not traditional yield, but more like an earn by being early opportunity.

The challenge is finding what matches your risk appetite. For some, it might be staking ETH for a steady 4-5%. For others, it is locking into a launchpool or CandyBomb type event to get exposure to new projects while also stacking potential rewards. Neither is free money, but both can work if you go in with the right expectations.",Then_Helicopter4243,2,6,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1njq7dj,I hope this tool helps you out on your way to build passive income,"One thing I’ve learned is that building passive income online isn’t just about having a product , it’s about building trust with people.

1njq513,are coupon & affiliate sites still a good source of passive income?,"Hey everyone, I’ve been looking into different online income ideas, and one that keeps coming up is coupon and affiliate websites.

* Build it into an affiliate coupon site as a long-term passive income project, or
* Sell it to someone who sees its potential.

* Has anyone here created a successful coupon or affiliate site?

So, I built an AI tool to track digital products on Etsy and Gumroad. My goal was simple: get alerts on real-time trends. What started as a small side project to solve my own problem turned into the ultimate blueprint for building a business with real demand.

Over the last few days, I've used this tool to find a winning digital product, and the results have been mind-blowing. I was able to make over **$150 from that single product in just a few days.**

I’m not here to sell you anything, I'm just a guy who built a tool to solve my own problem. If you're tired of making products that don't sell, I think this could help you too.

You can check it out and join the waitlist here, I'm releasing early access really soon: [**https://whop.com/TrendScope/**](https://whop.com/TrendScope/)

Feel free to ask me anything about my journey. I'm happy to share what I've learned.

1njp27z,"Passive income isn’t about “new money,” it’s about stopping the leaks","When I first got into ecom, I thought passive income meant launching products that sold in my sleep.   
  
Reality check: even when sales were coming in, I was still chained to support tickets, refunds, and endless “small tasks.” It didn’t feel passive at all.

The breakthrough came when I flipped the idea on its head: instead of trying to “make more,” I focused on **plugging revenue leaks**. Once those leaks were sealed, the income started to feel passive because it kept flowing without extra effort.

Here are some overlooked examples from my own stores:

1. **Refund automation** Refund requests used to kill my time. I set up a system where customers could click a link, choose a reason, and get an instant store credit instead of cash back. About 60% accepted it. That turned “lost money” into repeat business, and I never touched it again after setup.
2. **Silent churn catchers** Customers who stop buying rarely complain, they just vanish. I built a trigger that spotted anyone who hadn’t ordered in 90 days. It sent a friendly “we miss you” email with a small incentive. Those buyers quietly came back, and it runs in the background forever.
3. **Support FAQ that closes sales** I used to answer the same questions over and over: “How long is shipping?” “Does this work on X?” Instead of hiring more staff, I wrote short, human answers once and set them to auto-send via chat/email. Not only did it cut tickets in half, it actually converted fence-sitters into buyers.

None of this made headlines or felt sexy, but here’s the point: **passive income isn’t about finding magical streams, it’s about removing the tasks and frictions that keep your income from being passive in the first place.**

Curious to hear from this community: what’s one “boring” system you built once that keeps paying you back?",LionAny6818,2,0,[]

1njos9u,"Selling Weekly ""Lottos"" - Week 14 - $1536 Income using $132,500 Collateral.","Seems like its not allowed to post multiple images on this sub anymore so here is the link to my spreadsheet I update with all the benchmarks.

https://imgur.com/a/tJnPNOT

_

Every week I sell the equivalent of lottery tickets to gamblers in the stock market using options.


1. Everything I have is covered, meaning I have the cash and shares, and I don't use margin. 


2. I am happy to buy or sell the shares at those prices in this timeframe. 


3. Its not free money, all investing carries the risk of losses. I am being paid for this risk, usually.


_


This weeks winner: Me. I won 3 out of 3 contracts.


Total income made was $1536 using $132,500 worth of collateral for a 1.15% yield. This took about 30 minutes of logging in and selling to open then buying to close the contracts.


Closed positions:



UNH 300 Put: Sold for $313 and bought back for $136 . Total $177 profit using $30,000 worth of cash.



HOOD 100 Put x3:  Sold for $898 and bought back for $75. Total $823 profit using $30,000 worth of cash.



AMD 145 Put x5: Sold for $756 bought back for $220. Total $536 profit using $72,500 worth of cash.


_


My benchmarks are mostly unchanged but going the right direction. Still making an average around $1300 per week using $130,000 in risk. For 14 weeks total thats amazing.


At this point the average returns won't become very different unless I drastically change my trading style or the market changes sentiment.


My main goal moving forward is preserving my gains by reducing average risk while trying to maintain income.


_


This week was lucky and unlucky because I lost a lot of opportunity cost. If I just used the collateral for selling the puts and instead outright bought the shares I could have made $5,000-$10,000. All 3 stocks I sold puts on pumped like crazy. So there is a little bit of regret there.


But I didn't know they would do that, they could go down too. So my main reason for selling the cash secured puts was to have some breathing room to the downside.


The reason I do this is because not losing is more important to me than winning.


Overall I'm happy with this slow and steady passive income.


_

Over the past few months I've started studying how to build smart trips (open-jaw, multi-city, little-known local events). My question is twofold:
– Does it make sense to carry out a collaborative project on this topic, to differentiate itself from the usual “flash offer” channels?
– Or is it an already saturated field where we only risk wasting time?

I also wonder:
– Could something concrete arise (newsletter, community, premium channel)?
– Which model do you think has the most future: affiliations, subscriptions, free content with advertising?
– What personal experiences have you had with similar projects (travel or other sectors)?

Personally I believe that two heads are better than one: alone it is easy to lose focus, but together you can grow, test ideas, understand what really works.

I'm not looking for clients, but journey companions.

1njp1gw,Ways to Earn Extra Income Without it Becoming a Side Job?,"What are some ways that have worked for you to earn a little extra side income for a temporary period without it becoming too much of a ""side job""?

Little back story: I have always been really good with my husband and my finances and we make decent money as a married couple, but earlier this year we had to wipe out our savings and put over $4000 on our credit card due to unexpected medical bills. Usually, this wouldnt have been a problem since we used to be able to save and set aside a couple hundred dollars a month, but recently we havent been able to set anything aside due to how expensive the basic necessities have become as well as insurance and monthly expenses actively increasing. I am getting really overwhelmed as it seems like we cant get ""out of the hole"" and my credit score is dropping every time I check it. 

I currently work a full time job, and care for my 2 year old son on my days off so anything like Uber, Lyft, or food delivery options may not work every week. I am going to attempt to donate plasma again, but I was denied years ago due to my veins not being strong enough. I am even almost desperate enough to pull money from my 401k, but the penalties and taxes worry me.

I don't need this to be a forever thing, just however long it takes to pay off the card. I am open to really any idea, even if it sounds crazy, but please only if it has actually been beneficial to you. I don't want any scam or online survey options (I have tried many in the past, and they just dont pay a lot for the time it takes) I also don't want anything that I need to pay to use or sign up for some membership.

I appreciate all feedback, but please be kind. Thank you in advance!

1niobbl,SaaS 'passive income' reality: $9K MRR but 20 hours/week. Here's the honest breakdown.,"Everyone sells SaaS as passive income. 16 months in with $9K MRR - here's the real story.

**Weekly time breakdown:**

- Customer support: 6 hours (even with automation)

- Product development: 8 hours (features, bugs, improvements)

- Marketing/content: 4 hours (SEO, social, partnerships)

- Admin/business: 2 hours (finances, planning, metrics)

- **Total: 20 hours/week**

**What's actually ""passive"":** ✅ Billing and payments (Stripe handles everything)\
&#x20;✅ Basic onboarding (automated email sequences) ✅ Simple support (chatbot resolves 60% of issues) ✅ Infrastructure (cloud services handle scaling)

**What's not passive:** ❌ Feature development (customers always want more) ❌ Complex support issues (need human touch)\
&#x20;❌ Content marketing (algorithm changes constantly) ❌ Competition (market always evolving)

**The progression:**

- Months 1-6: $1K MRR, 40 hours/week (unsustainable)

- Months 7-12: $5K MRR, 30 hours/week (getting better)

- Months 13-16: $9K MRR, 20 hours/week (sustainable lifestyle)

**How I got here:** Stopped trying to figure everything out myself. Studied 300+ successful SaaS founders and followed their proven systems.

**The game-changer:** Using frameworks instead of winging it. Built everything based on what already worked for other founders.

**I documented everything at** [**foundertoolkit.org**](http://foundertoolkit.org)**:**

- Database of 300+ profitable founder journeys

- Proven business frameworks and automation strategies

- Ready-to-use code templates (NextJS + Stripe + Supabase)

- Customer acquisition systems

- Growth and scaling playbooks

Bottom line: $9K MRR for 20 hours/week beats any job, but ""passive"" is misleading. It's leveraged income that requires smart systems.

1nj4jcd,Mobile games income,"Hey everyone, hope you're doing well.
Little background: I've been working in game development for the past three years, and I've held both full-time and freelance positions during this time. The company I used to work with used to make its own games. Small/medium mobile games can be created within a month, and then earn a handsome amount from them.

Back in 23, I started making games for myself and also doing freelance work, and mobile games will always be the top side hustle.

So far, I have launched 20+ of my own games on the Play Store/ App Store, and have worked with 50+ international clients and developed games for them, and small game studios that outsourced their games to me. I have to say, it's a win-win for both parties. They earn by running ads on their games, and I, by developing it for them.

Although there is one thing I won't mislead anyone here, IT'S NOT AN OVERNIGHT GET-RICH SCHEME. It takes around one month to get it all running. After that, you're good to go.

If any of you are looking for a side hustle and want to earn some $$, this is the right niche and the perfect time to get into game dev.

1nirsyk,Passive income from AI GPUs: 100% depreciation + 50% yields,"I’ve been digging into a niche that almost nobody in the mainstream passive income space talks about, but wealthy investors are already piling into it: high-performance compute (HPC) GPUs.

This is a brand new industry. AI is only a couple of years old, but it's already a trillion dollar a year market and shows no signs of stopping. 

Here’s why it’s interesting:

* Yields are high. Current GPUs are throwing off \~50% APRs. Yes, that sounds wild, but demand for AI compute is so insatiable right now that operators will pay. 
* Under the current bonus depreciation rules (OBBB), **you can write off 100% of the GPU cost in year one**. Let me say that again... you get **100% tax write off** on the equipment in the first year. This part alone makes it incredible for passive investing as you can offset any ordinary income your business has. 
* Cash flows are modeled like any other hard asset. For example, NVIDIA’s new B200s rent around $4/hr today, and if you assume \~15% price decay per year (down to \~$2.40/hr over a few years).

The “passive” part is you don’t run the GPUs yourself. There are many, many brokers out there who will help you purchase, get operational, and find service agreements. They will walk you through the process, just like using a management company for real estate.

**This is not for everyone.** The GPU's cost $100ks for clusters. 

**Hardware Purchase Prices**

* **NVIDIA H100 (PCI-e):** \~$25K–30K each
* **NVIDIA H100 (SXM / multi-GPU systems):** $300K+ for 8-GPU configs
* **NVIDIA H200:** \~50% premium over H100 SXM; 
* **NVIDIA B200:** \~$30K–40K per card; \~$500K for 8× B200 DGX systems

But the good part about this is that it's highly, highly scalable. And the machines have a 5-7 year operation timeline. Plus the OBBB tax treatment makes it the most interesting asset class to put your funds to for the next couple of decades.

1njfptg,I would like some help or advice for making money online.,"Hi Everyone, I am a 16 year-old with zero pocket money.

I wanted to earn money from all the opportunities online so I first decided to start with KDP low/no content publishing but all I had was a Monthly Canva pro and I didn't have money for research tools, ads or freelancers or ghostwriters. I made around 30 books but I realised that I would need some kind of investment to start selling so I decided to try high content which were selling better organically, but there also I stumbled into a problem that if I wanted to create actually good selling books I wanted to invest in ghostwriters and other tools and that my low-effort AI generated books won't do any good at all. So I decided that I will first do some graphic design freelancing using canva and use the money I earn from that to invest in 'passive' income businesses like KDP or drop shipping. But in the time when I don't have an active client i am looking forward to do Digital Products like templates and some ebooks. But I think that if I try to do this as well i migh spread my attention to thin and would get neither of them done.

Hey everyone,

When I launched my Android app *Take Notes* a month ago, I’ll admit I was skeptical about ever getting a paying user. The Play Store is overflowing with note-taking apps, and I wasn’t sure anyone would notice mine. But I figured if I could provide real value—a fast, private, and simple notepad—maybe it would find its audience.

**After a month of launching, two users bought the “Remove Ads” option**, and ad revenue is starting to climb too. It’s not life-changing money, but it’s an amazing feeling to know someone found enough value to pay.

**What the app does**  
*Take Notes* is a lightweight, privacy-focused notepad:

* ✏️ Simple & private — works completely offline
* 🌓 Clean light & dark theme
* 🆓 3-day ad-free trial, then keep ads (which are not intrusive btw) or pay once to remove them forever

I guess this just proves that if you build something genuinely useful, people will reward it—even in a crowded space.

1nje9vz,Join now before it’s to kate,"Hi all. I wanted to share a side hustle I recently started that’s been surprisingly beginner-friendly and works even while I’m sleeping. It’s called Texit Coin mining.

Basically, instead of trading crypto or watching charts all day, you run a miner that helps power the Texit Coin network—and in return, you earn rewards. I liked it because it’s more of a “set it and forget it” type of income stream once you’re set up.

I started small just to test it out, and so far, it’s been running smoothly. I know crypto isn’t for everyone, but if you’re looking for something new to add to your income streams, it’s worth checking out—especially while it’s still early.

1nj1kcj,If you're thinking about starting your own business or passive income. These are the 8 foundations I see most beginners ignoring and why they don't succeed (or even get results),"Hey guys so I have been part of this community for a bit now. Have chimed in and provided tips and advice here and there. Even recently made a comment that got nearly 500 upvotes on the importance of mindset in entrepreneurism on a post.

https://preview.redd.it/rqcvbnj3ylpf1.jpg?width=1957&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62317ec0d5d4b4bdc0b63afd6fb07262d506772e

That showed me that people are hungry for this sort of stuff. So I thought potentially sharing this might be valuable to some here. As I know many here are beginners and lots not even classified as beginners but really ""maybers"" or ""thinking abouters"" (not trying to be rude just the truth haha)

But yes on the back of that comment and the fact that many newbies and beginners hang around here. I thought id share the 8 things I see as foundational must haves when starting your own online business or income stream.

These are nothing 'revolutionary' yet most beginners completely overlook them none the less.

**The 8 foundations:**

**1. Know your WHY**  
Your why is what fuels you when things get tough and obstacles arise (which they will) and helps you move from pushing to succeed to being pulled to succeed

**2. Be valuable, not just different**  
Don't just start a store for the sake of it or 'make some money' actually be valuable, fill a need, solve a problem, be unique, bring value to the marketplace.

**3. Understand your audience**  
If you're selling to everyone you're selling to no one. Know you audience and pick a niche don't just sell random products with no clear audience or niche

**4. Nail branding and design**  
People decide in 3 seconds if they trust your store. Get your store design on point. Not a clunky throw together. Ensure you have good design, that flows well, is clear about who you are and what you sell and why people should by from you (what makes you unique or different), good copy (customer focused not you or your brand focused)

**5. Set up email marketing from day one:**  
Even just  simple free give away like a coupon code for example with a signup form on your site puts you ahead of 90% of new stores. And starts building your list from day one. Your future self will thank you later.

**6. Don’t ignore SEO**  
Page titles, image alt tags, collection descriptions. Takes 10 minutes and it builds over time.

**7. Make a plan**  
Don’t just wing it. Make a simple checklist. Set realistic income goals. Reward progress, not perfection. I.e Actionable milestones like first sale, first $100, $200, $500, $5k,, 10k etc. Reward yourself along the way. Not 'once you become a millionaire' it will be so much more enjoyable and sutainable. Helping you feel like you're winning rather than constantly 'losing' because you are not a 'millionaire in 30 days' like the gurus told you they did.

**8. Mindset is everything**  
Most people quit way too early. Expect to fail. Expect to learn. Keep showing up and you’ll outlast 90 percent of others. Having your why also ties into mindset very well ""he who knows his why can bear almost any how.""

Those are just a quick breakdown of the foundations but hopefully you found them valuable :)

If you would like to go deeper with them I actually have a completly free video version. It's geared towards the frame of starting a shopify store but even if thats not what you are thinking about doing these foundations apply to starting almost any online business or product.

1niskv1,Secret Strategies Some People Use to Make Real Money Online,"Most guides online give you surface-level advice: start a YouTube channel, sell products, or take surveys. But if you want to make **real, consistent income**, there are some lesser-known strategies that actually work:

1. **Build a community around value** – People pay to be part of something exclusive, where they learn, interact, and grow. The stronger the community, the more they’re willing to invest.
2. **Leverage micro-subscriptions** – Even $5–$10 per month per member can add up fast if your community is engaged.
3. **Focus on repeat value, not one-time sales** – The secret is creating content or services that members come back for, month after month.

I’ve seen some people turn these strategies into **hundreds or even thousands of dollars per month**.

Curious? Share your thoughts or experiences—what strategies have actually worked for you online?",Yahyaawad,1,0,[]

1nhzs56,How can I realistically make at least 1000 a month with no degree and bad social anxiety ?,"I have been browsing around reddit and I see people saying they make 3k or 4k a month like its nothing. Honestly I dont need that. I just need 1000 a month steady so I can support my family and finally have some space to work on myself.

About me so you understand where I am coming from:
I have no higher education or degree..
I dont have much work experience..
I struggle with severe social anxiety so I cannot do regular in person jobs or heavy customer interaction. Even small conversations are tough for me...
I am still ready to work hard but I need something where I can focus on the work itself and not constant social interaction.

What I am looking for
Real and practical ideas that can help me reach 1000 a month consistently. 
Work I can start this month even if it takes some time to grow.
Preferably remote or online so I can avoid my anxiety triggers.
Something simple but honest where I can build slowly.
Small investment is ok but nothing crazy. Under 200 if possible.

I am not asking for pyramid schemes or fake marketing stuff. Just want real examples. If you are doing something that pays you and could also work for someone like me please share. Even if its slow or boring I will take it seriously.

Right now life feels like a loop. I have no degree and only minimum wage options and when I do those jobs I have no energy left to learn new skills. Add the social anxiety and it feels impossible. I just need 1000 a month steady to breathe and then I can focus on actually building a skill.

1nirae7,Found a Blog discussing a tool that can create personalized storybooks for kids using AI,"Few months ago I started to building coloring books for amazon kdp. But I stumbled onto something that's completely changed my perspective.

**To be hones what I have seen so far coloring books:**

* Market is absolutely flooded
* Average selling price: $3-6
* Race to the bottom on pricing
* Minimal customer engagement

**What I discovered instead:** Personalized children's storybooks are the actual goldmine. Here's why:

* **3X higher profit margins** ($8-15+ vs $3-6)
* **340% market growth** in 2024 alone
* **Way less competition** (higher barrier to entry)
* **Better customer reviews** (emotional value)

  
Also, I think this can be very good resource to give your kids a book as a gift and this platform can be made more interactive, more cretaive for kids using AI.

I would love to get your thoughts as well

I’m excited (and a little nervous) to share that I’ve just created my very first digital product — a self-discipline workbook! 🌱

1nikw86,"Coaches, course & community creators: what's your biggest headache right now? (doing some research for an AI tool I'm making)","Hey everyone, I’m just looking for feedback and conversation - I don’t want this to come across as a pitch.

Over the last year, I sold courses to over 1,000 students. It was a great experience, but it also showed me just how exhausting and messy the backend of running this kind of business can get.

Landing pages, funnels, email/WhatsApp marketing, managing a community - it felt like I was spending more time messing with tools than actually teaching and supporting students.

That frustration is what pushed me to start building an AI co-founder that can handle all of that “behind the scenes” work for course creators, coaches, and community builders.

Basically, anyone selling digital products.

The thing is - I don’t want to build in a vacuum. I know my own struggles, but I don’t know everyone else’s.

And maybe what I think is the biggest pain point isn’t the one that actually matters most.

So I’d love to connect with people who are actively running courses, coaching programs, or communities.

I'm reaching out with an idea people might be interested in. Market research panels are a quick way to get some cash without too much investment; you simply sign up for the panel and people will be contacted when a relevant survey comes your way.

  
For example, I'm currently recruiting for an online interview with people who are doing stock and options trading casually on a regular basis in Canada, with 150$ earned for every person who interviews.

1nh9xqx,The 7 Passive Income Streams I’d Start From Scratch If I Had $0 & No Skills,"If I had to start over from scratch, no money, no audience, no skills people would pay for  these are the 7 passive income streams I’d lock in on, no question. I’ve tried dozens of ideas, and most either cost too much upfront or turned out to be dressed up day jobs. The seven I’m about to share? They’re all truly passive (after setup), free to start, and don’t require you to be some tech wizard. You just need to be resourceful and consistent, that’s it. These are the plays that actually move the needle when you’re starting with nothing.

Let’s talk digital products first which is absolute gold. You create something once (Notion templates, planners, simple eBooks, checklists), upload it to Gumroad or Etsy, and that one thing can keep making you money for months. No need to overthink it. I literally started by turning my personal productivity system into a Notion template, posted it with zero expectations, and it sold and kept selling. Combine that with affiliate marketing, and you’ve got a system. But the key is to do it right: don’t just drop links. Instead, show how the product helps you, in real content like a TikTok tutorial, a Medium write up, or a YouTube Shorts breakdown. That content works 24/7 while you sleep.

Print-on-demand is another killer stream if you play it smart. You design a shirt, mug, or hoodie once using free tools like Canva, and upload to Printful or Redbubble they handle the rest. No inventory, no shipping headaches. But don’t just make basic “Motivational Monday” stuff. Niche down hard. I tanked my first store trying to appeal to everyone. Once I got hyper-specific with a niche I actually knew, boom, organic sales. And while YouTube and blogging are slower to pop off, they’re traffic machines once they do. One tutorial video or blog post can feed traffic to your product or affiliate link for years if you’re smart about SEO and evergreen content.

The best part? You don’t have to juggle all seven ideas. Pick one that matches your vibe and stick with it. Set it up once and let it compound while you build the next. Passive income is just building systems that don’t need you 24/7. If you want the full breakdown like how I actually structured these, which platforms I used, what worked vs what didn’t, I put everything in a free resource you can find in my bio (youtube video lol). Just the things I wish someone handed me when I was starting out.",Own-Mud8463,526,95,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1ni0agg,How can I get my wife involved or find something for her to do?,"I have a full-time job, plus I juggle freelancing on the side and also run my own printing business. I’m a graphic designer by trade, so most of what I do is very skill-based.

The challenge is, my wife has little to no knowledge about my work. She’s not a tech person, and her English and computer skills are pretty limited. I sometimes ask her for help with small things, but it’s not really her area. We have a nanny who helps take care of the kids, so in theory she does have some free time.

My frustration is that she doesn’t really contribute financially. I even asked her to try being more active on social media like appearing in videos for our business but it feels like she’s only doing it for me. To her, it’s more of a chore, and honestly, I get tired of reminding her every time.

She’s an amazing woman and very beautiful, but I feel stuck. We’re living paycheck to paycheck, and I really need help. The problem is that she can’t really help with my business directly since it’s so tied to my specific skills.

I’m looking for advice: how do I find something she can do? Something that makes her feel involved and contributes to our household without me constantly pushing?

1ni9sx4,How I cut SEO wait time from weeks to days,"At first, I thought SEO was only about piling up backlinks. I’d swap, guest post, drop links anywhere I could and then sit back. Weeks would pass and half of those links never even showed up in Google. No index meant no traffic.

I ignored indexing because I assumed Google would do it for me. That mistake slowed me down more than I realized.

Things shifted when I started running an indexing loop. Every new batch, blog posts, affiliate pages, landing pages, goes through the same flow: submit, ping in bulk, check what sticks. I can push around 200 links a day this way, and if I batch it weekly, it takes less than an hour.

I saw the results quickly. Posts that stayed invisible before started showing impressions in a few days. Affiliate pages I’d written off began ranking for long-tail keywords. Even old landing pages I forgot about started getting visits once they got indexed.

That’s when indexing stopped being background work and started feeling like progress. Instead of chasing more backlinks, I made sure the ones I had were counted. It cut costs, sped things up, and turned SEO from waiting around into something moving forward.

It’s not huge money, but it’s steady. Getting indexed in days instead of weeks gives my side projects - blogs, Etsy shops, digital products, a chance to earn sooner.

Indexing became one of those small habits that actually moved my numbers. If you try it, you might notice the same lift.",Material-Escape1057,2,1,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1nid9ph,Neighborhood Job Ideas?,"Looking for ideas that I could do around my neighborhood to make a bit of money! This is what I have so far:

- leaf sweeping/leaf blowing
- car washing
- weed killing
- lawn mowing (need their lawnmower)
- edging grass boarders
- cleaning up dog 💩
- power washing
- pruning/cleaning up shrubs (not tall trees though, just bushes etc)

I’m not sure what to charge for the services, and I would also like advice about door to door selling. People don’t like that nowadays, my neighborhood has a Facebook page which I can use for promo too and my dad is part of the neighborhood council where he often cleans the estate and picks up litter so people are familiar with our family and house number which is a good bonus!

1nid2rs,Rev-share in mobile gaming as a source of passive income,"Most affiliate models are based on CPA or flat fees. But in gaming, there’s something interesting — rev-share.  
The idea is simple: bring in a player, and as long as they spend in-game, you get a % of that spend.

Why it feels attractive for passive income:

* A single player can keep “dripping” revenue for months (sometimes over a year).
* The product sustains itself — games run constant content/events that keep players active.
* No caps — the more players you accumulate, the steadier your payouts become.

1nhktqe,"Learned to code, built a SaaS, now have paid customers from 60+ countries","Last year I first had the idea for [my latest project](https://buildpad.io).

I wanted to create a platform where founders get everything they need to build their products.

Now I’m proud to say that we have 15,000+ founders on our platform.

But let’s back up a bit so you can see how I got here.

Here’s a high level overview of my story:

* Ran a successful SaaS with two buddies but had serious issues scaling it further than $30k/month
* I had 0 coding skills at this point and got tired of the whole project being so dependent on our developer. Things weren’t moving fast enough
* July of 2023 I finally decided to take things into my own hands and learned to code
* Spent 5 months going through the App Academy course
* December of 2023 I had a decent foundation and I started building the first project on my own as practice. Was super exciting.
* February of 2024 the project was done. I felt it had some commercial potential but I wasn’t sure how to market it yet
* The same month I get a call from my sibling. It was a Friday afternoon. He was looking for a career change and I had briefly suggested us working together so he followed me up on that.
* March of 2024 he moves from Sweden (our home country) to join me in Budapest.
* We work our asses of trying to market the product I had built
* We remained hopeful for a long time but in July of 2024 we finally throw in the towel. No one wanted the product. Stressful times…
* We took that failure and my previous experience and tried to learn everything we could. What had gone wrong? What could we do better?
* The mistakes we had made were clear, and we realized tons of other entrepreneurs were making the same mistakes. So we built our next product around that.
* Actually, we didn’t start by building, that was one of the mistakes we had made before. We started by validating our idea.
* Then we launched, went pretty well, learned from user feedback.
* 3 months in we’re doing $2k/mo. Good start.
* We continue spending a lot of time improving the product. We also get better at content marketing. 6 months in we’re doing $6k/mo. This is starting to look really good.
* Then we make some really good product decisions such as completely changing our interface. Many users didn’t like it at first but turned out to be good. We also start exploring paid marketing more.

Today we’re almost 1 year in. We’re doing $14k/mo and I’m loving the grind of improving the product. Being the developer of the project fits me much better as it gives me full control of how fast we can make improvements.

Just thought I’d share my story for people that are considering learning to code or becoming an entrepreneur.",felixheikka,23,3,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

I'd love to hear feedback on whats good or bad and how they can be improved etc but you dont have to.

So, my question is what would you do with a spare $100 per week? 

Here is the scenario:

* The $100/week is after all living expenses have been made. This is just spare cash.
* You are starting at zero. Zero savings, zero investment portfolio and zero skills to sell.

1nhrqj0,Just casually stumbled into earning crypto rewards while trading sharing my experience,"You know how sometimes the best side hustles come from a random chat with a friend? That's exactly what happened to me last week. My friend casually drops that he pocketed 20 BGB just from some trading on Bitget Onchain, and I'm like, ""Wait, what's that? Sign me up!"" Turns out, it was part of their trading competitions, but I missed the last round by a hair. Fast forward to today, and boom Phase 53 just kicked off. It's got these three tokens in the spotlight: $CUDIS, $USDUC, and $VELO. I figured, why not dip my toes in while the iron's hot? It's not like I'm quitting my day job, but layering in some rewards on trades feels like that low-effort boost we all chase here.
What hooked me hardest was $CUDIS not just the hype, but the actual stuff behind it. They've got this smart ring that's turning heads for tracking health metrics in a super user-friendly way, and their tokenized rewards system puts everyday folks (like me) right in the loop, earning points for real engagement. I've been riding its steady uptrend, swapping positions without overthinking it, and the BGB rewards are stacking up nicer than expected. It's got me wondering if this is the kind of ""active passive"" play where you trade smart once and let the ecosystem do the rest. Anyone else messing around with these tokens or similar on-chain setups? Would love to hear your takes on blending utility projects with reward farming.

1nhktc6,Why Only 10% of Digital Product Launches Actually Succeed (And How to Join Them),"Just saw another course creator hit $50k in their first month while most others struggle to make their first sale. The difference isn't luck or a better product - it's understanding how successful launches actually work.

The 10% who succeed all do one thing differently: they build relationships before they sell. Instead of throwing ads at cold traffic hoping for instant sales, they create a system that turns strangers into buyers over time.

Here's their playbook: offer something valuable for free first, nurture those leads with helpful content, then present your paid product to people who already trust you. Simple concept but most people skip straight to the sales pitch.

The successful ones also use proper funnel systems that automate this entire process. You can literally set up sequences that turn website visitors into customers while you sleep. The technology got so good in 2025 that even non-tech people are building these systems.

What's wild is some of the best performing funnels are built on completely free platforms. You don't need expensive tools to replicate what the top 10% are doing. You just need the right strategy and tools that actually convert.

I spent weeks analyzing what the successful digital product sellers use for their funnels. Tested everything from free options to enterprise solutions, found some clear winners.

The patterns are consistent across every successful launch I studied. Same funnel structure, same automation approach, just different products.

DM me if you want to see exactly what tools and strategies the top performers use - happy to share the complete breakdown.",StretchDue6895,1,0,[]

1nhyl8s,I used my AI tool to find a winning digital product that made me $53 in my first day.,"Hey everyone,

I've been a part of this community for a while now and I've seen countless posts about people struggling to create passive income streams. I've been there myself. I was stuck in a cycle of building projects that no one wanted to buy. It's like trying to build a beautiful house without a blueprint—you might have great intentions, but you'll get nowhere fast.

I finally realized the problem wasn't my skills, but my approach. I needed to switch my focus from **building** to **finding**. I needed a way to discover what people were actually buying, not just what I thought was a good idea.

So, I built an AI tool to track digital products on Etsy and Gumroad. My goal was simple: get alerts on real-time trends. What started as a small side project to solve my own problem turned into the ultimate blueprint for building a business with real demand.

Over the last month, using the tool, I was able to launch a new digital product. The data was telling me exactly what to build. I made my first sale a couple of hours after launching, and by the end of the day, I was completely blown away. I made over 5 sales (remember, in just one day) and had earned over **$53 from that single product.**

I’m not here to sell you anything, I'm just a guy who built a tool to solve my own problem, so I share it for people with the same problem. If you're tired of making products that don't sell, I think this could help you too.

1nhk00o,[Idea] A tool for affiliate marketers – smart redirection by audience,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking about a tool for affiliate marketers and wanted to get your thoughts. I don’t know if this would be useful, so I’m asking here.

# Problem

Affiliate marketers share links on multiple platforms (Reddit, blogs, Quora, etc.). But the same product can feel *budget-friendly* in one country and *too expensive* in another.

Example: You share a “budget-friendly mobile” for **$399**.

* A USA visitor might think: “Yes, that’s budget.”
* An Indian visitor might think: “That’s expensive.”

This mismatch can hurt conversions.

# Solution

A tool where you can **stack different affiliate product links into one smart link**.

* Example: iPhone 17 + Redmi Note inside one link.
* A USA visitor clicks → gets redirected to iPhone 17.
* An Indian visitor clicks → gets redirected to Redmi Note.
* The redirection is based on country, device, past browsing context, etc.

That way, you don’t miss the selling opportunity, and each user sees the product most relevant to them.

Would a tool like this be useful for affiliate marketers? Curious to hear honest thoughts.",None,1,0,[]

Use Canva to design them, then list on platforms like Gumroad or Etsy. These can continue selling without you needing to be online all the time.\n\nAnother solid route is print on demand. You create simple designs for shirts, journals, mugs or tote bags, and upload them using a platform like Printful that connects with Etsy. They handle printing and shipping, so once your products are listed, your job is just creating content or posts that drive attention to them.\n\nDropshipping is also beginner-friendly. I’d recommend starting on eBay because they already have traffic, so you don’t need to run ads. Find trending or seasonal products, list them, and only pay for them after someone buys.\n\nYou can also create a newsletter using Beehiiv or start a simple blog with WordPress. Pick a topic you’re interested in, and use it to grow an audience. You can earn by recommending products as an affiliate, selling digital downloads, or offering low-ticket services. Amazon’s affiliate program is a great place to begin.\n\nYouTube is another great option. You can start a faceless channel where you share your journey, lessons you're learning, or review useful tools. If you're shy, you don’t need to show your face, just use visuals from Canva or stock footage, and add voiceover with tools like ElevenLabs. Once your videos are up, they can earn through ads, affiliate links, or by promoting your own digital products.\n\nAll of these work better if you learn how to create persuasive content. If you know how to write or talk in a way that gets attention and trust, you can sell anything.

The thing about startup investing is that it requires way more due diligence and active involvement than people expect. You\'re not just buying shares and forgetting about them like with public stocks.\n\nThe venture capital model itself is fascinating but also pretty exclusive. Most real VC funds require you to be an accredited investor (making $200k+ annually or having $1M+ net worth) and even then the minimums are usually $25k-$100k+ per deal. \n\nThat\'s why I ended up building Angel Squad at Hustle Fund, we wanted to lower those barriers so people could get into startup investing with minimums as low as $1k.

I’m 35, a cancer survivor still in recovery, and working full-time in IT support. My job pays the basics, but with ongoing medical expenses and another surgery planned in the coming months, it’s really not enough to keep things stable.

1ngylij,are Still not on Benable?,"Hey everyone, I just started using this app called Benable and thought I’d share my experience since some of you might find it useful.

Basically, Benable lets you earn money by recommending products and services you already use and love. You just create lists (like “My favorite headphones,” “Best travel gadgets,” or even “Coffee gear I swear by”) and then share them. When people buy through your links, you earn commissions.

What I like about it:
	•	Super easy to set up – no complicated affiliate applications.
	•	Feels more authentic than spamming random links since you’re curating stuff you genuinely use.
	•	I’ve already had a couple of clicks and it’s pretty exciting to see the potential.

1nharsc,"I bought a $3,000 Nissan Versa. It earns me $800/month. Here’s how:",":

Most people see cars as liabilities. Payments, gas, insurance, repairs… it feels like they only drain your pockets.

But I started looking at cars differently. What if they weren’t just liabilities, but assets?

Last year, I picked up a 2014 Nissan Versa Note for around $3,000. Instead of driving it myself, I put it into a system where gig workers (Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, Spark) could lease it and use it to earn their own income.

Here’s the crazy part → that $3,000 car now earns me ~$800 every single month, passively.

I don’t manage renters.

I don’t handle maintenance (it’s automated).

I don’t chase payments.


The system I use (called Wheel Estate™) takes care of all of that.

Now, imagine if you had 5 cars like that. That’s $4,000/month from vehicles that would otherwise be sitting in driveways losing value.

It’s not Turo. It’s a completely different structure that keeps the cars rented out consistently and passively.

1nh3jzm,I used this AI tool to find a winning digital product that made me $150 in three days.,"Hey everyone,

I've been a part of this community for a while now and I've seen countless posts about people struggling to create passive income streams. I've been there myself. I spent months building digital products that no one wanted to buy. It was incredibly frustrating and a huge waste of time.

So, I decided to do something different. I built my own AI tool to track digital product trends on platforms like Etsy and Gumroad. I used it for a week, and the results were mind-blowing. I found a new product idea that was starting to go viral, and I decided to build it myself.

I won't bore you with the details, but a few days later, I had my first sale. I was shocked. By the end of the week, I had made over $150 from that single product. It was a complete game-changer. I'm no longer guessing, I'm just looking at the data.

I'm not here to sell you anything, I'm here to share what worked for me and to get some feedback from people who know this struggle.

1ng2yv6,I used this AI tool to find a digital product that made me $125 in a weekend.,"Hey everyone,

I've been following this community for a while now, and I've noticed a recurring problem that I struggled with for months. We all want that sweet passive income, but finding a digital product that people actually want to buy is like finding a needle in a haystack. I launched so many projects that I was excited about, only to get radio silence after the launch. It was soul-crushing.

Eventually, I realized I was doing it all wrong. I was guessing what people wanted. I needed to switch my focus from **building** to **finding**.

So, I started messing with some automation to track digital products on Etsy and Gumroad. My goal was simple: get an alert whenever a new product started to get some real attention.

1ngo5yq,I built an AI tool to find winning digitals products and it helped me earn $873 in my first two weeks.,"Hey everyone,

I've been a long-time member of this community and I've seen countless posts about people struggling to create passive income streams. I've been there myself. For months, I was stuck in a cycle of building products that no one wanted to buy. It's like trying to build a beautiful house without a blueprint—you might have great intentions, but you'll get nowhere fast.

I finally realized the problem wasn't my skills, but my approach. I needed to switch my focus from **building** to **finding**. I needed a way to discover what people were actually buying, not just what I thought was a good idea.

So, I built an AI tool to track winning digital products on Etsy and Gumroad. My goal was simple: get alerts on real-time trends. What started as a small side project to solve my own problem turned into the ultimate blueprint for building a business with real demand.

Over the last two weeks, using the tool, I was able to launch a new digital product. The data was telling me exactly what to build. I made my first sale a few days after launching, and by the end of the month, I was completely blown away. I had earned over **$873 from that single product in just two weeks.**

I'm just a guy who built a tool to solve my own problem, and now I'm giving you the opportunity to try it yourself. If you're tired of making products that don't sell, I think this could help you too.

This was from one of my theme pages. I make a social media page around a certain niche then post to it, monetized in one or multiple ways.

Examples:

* Dating and relationships
* Gardening
* Moms/parenting
* Pets

This page is monetized with a creator program + digital product sales.

I applied to the creator program when the page was brand new at zero followers and got accepted. I also promote my digital products (ebooks, etc.).

**This was one of my top-viewed posts.**

* 6.5+ million views
* $654

Once you find a formula for your content, identifying the best performers for you audience, you just rinse and repeat the process.

It can turn into passive income, as you the posts you make today can pay into the future.

If you're good with social media, I'd recommend this. You can do it with X, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and other socials.

# What you should consider

This is free to start. Just pick a social channel and theme then start posting content. You'll get better over time. 

Just post in the beginning and you get better over time with content, knowing what performs best, and make sure you pay attention to your metrics like what are top times your audience responds to your posts.

# My results

This page started earlier this year (around April/May) at zero. It has grown to 15K followers now. I post 1-2 times a day, most days out of the week.

It's recommended to post 3 times a day, in a mix of formats - posts, reels/video posts, stories.

I've made over $2,500 from this page so far.

So, 6.5mill and $654.

1nfx2x9,Help people who want to start learning digital products,"1.	⁠Pick a Niche People Actually Care About Focus on things like money, health, self-help, productivity. People are always looking for ways to improve in these areas. Check out best-sellers on Etsy, Gumroad, and Amazon Kindle. If a product is doing well, there’s probably a reason.
2.	⁠Make a Product People Actually Want Don’t just create something that’s “nice to know.” Make it a solution. Don’t just do a basic “How to be Productive” guide, go deeper. Make something like a “7-Day Focus Reset Challenge.” It needs to be actionable, something people can use right away to solve their problem.
3.	⁠Start Simple You don’t need to make a complicated product. Canva’s free version is all you need to get started. Pick a template, tweak it, and boom, you’ve got a product. Start with small things, a budget planner, an ebook, a workout plan, whatever fits your niche.
4.	⁠Sell It the Right Way I use Gumroad, and it’s perfect for simple digital products. Create a freebie or mini version to get people interested, and share it everywhere, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit. Don’t just spam “buy my stuff,” give them value first, show how your product actually helps.
5.	⁠Don’t Overthink, Just Launch Trust me, I wasted way too much time trying to perfect things. Launch it, even if it’s not perfect, and fix it later. Done is better than perfect.
6.	⁠Get Traffic Like a Pro I made my first $10K without spending a dime on ads, just pure organic marketing. TikTok was huge for me, short videos sharing quick wins or busting myths. Instagram Reels worked great too. Post daily and focus on getting your content out there, not stressing over perfection.
7.	⁠Price for Value Don’t price based on how much time you spent. Think about the value it provides. $27–$97 is a sweet spot for quick sales, and people will pay for something that solves their problems.

1nfz2pe,Is a tiny emergency fund enough to start investing,"Personal finance advice often says build a 6 month emergency fund before you invest. That makes sense if your income is unstable or expenses are unpredictable. But for someone with a steady paycheck and access to a low interest buffer, waiting years to hit a big number can delay compounding. I am curious where the real tipping point is.

Run a quick example. You save 300 per month. Option A: you stack cash until you hit 9,000 for six months of expenses, which takes 30 months. Only then do you start investing. Option B: you build a 1,500 buffer in five months, then split 150 to cash and 150 to a broad index fund. After 30 months, Option B has roughly 1,500 to 3,000 more invested, plus the smaller buffer still growing. The tradeoff is risk. A surprise expense in Option B might force a temporary 0 percent card plan or a small withdrawal during a dip.

I like a layered approach. First, hit one month of expenses in cash as fast as possible. Second, enroll in automatic contributions at a level you cannot feel, even 50 a week. Third, keep adding to cash until you hit two to three months. After that, let raises or side hustle income push the invest number higher. Guardrails help, keep a small line of credit for true emergencies, set a rule that investing pauses but never reverses, and avoid high interest debt at all costs.

Where do you draw the line in your own plan, and what cash target felt safe enough to start investing without losing sleep?",ThrowRA62728382,2,10,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

You design shirts, mugs, journals or similar products using Canva, then connect to Etsy through a platform like Printful. You don’t need to manage inventory or ship anything yourself. Etsy already has built-in traffic so you don't have to pay for ads right away.\n\nIf you want to move a little faster, try dropshipping on eBay. Since eBay already has traffic, you don’t need to spend extra money driving visitors.

Best of luck and I hope you earn some extra money using the referrals below :) Please read T&Cs to ensure you’ve met the requirements of the offer during the given timeframe.
Just a disclaimer that I do receive a small amount if you use my referral links, I appreciate it so much!

Sign up offers:

UBank - $30 sign up offer using my code: LTMZCCB

ING Bank - $100 sign up offer using my code: KNC484

Raiz - $5 sign up with my code to start investing your side income: CH8UXW

Shopback - $20 sign up bonus with my code: A9vTX0




Side Hustles:

Menulog Delivery Driving - $50 sign up offer with my code: HTJUBK

I also have links for some other side hustles but they don’t have any incentives currently, just dm me and i can send you them as reddit doesn’t allow links. 
- Smartspotter - An app for micro tasks like going to the grocery store and taking some photos, counting stock ect. Very easy tasks and I made $50 yesterday from these tasks alone
- Octopus Surveys - I usually avoid surveys like the plague but this site claims to be the highest paying site in Australia and I definitely agree. It’;s not minimum wage but being able to make an extra $20 a week that can be invested is always nice!
- Market Research - Google local market research companies in your area and send out the same generic email to them all, asking if they need participants for surveys, focus groups, user testing ect. It’s usually quite decent pay and can be cash in hand or gift cards. There’s no experience required either which is nice. I have an online zoom call for an hour next week that’s paying $80 in cash :)

1nfzjbe,Why your passive income plan needs a boredom test,"Most passive income ideas look great in a spreadsheet and fall apart in a calendar. The boredom test is simple: if the system cannot run during a boring month where you barely think about it, it is not passive for you. You want one page of rules, one calendar reminder, and fixes that take minutes, not hours.

Try this tiny plan. Step 1, define the asset and the autopilot. Cash bucket in a high yield account with auto transfers. Long term bucket in a broad index fund with auto invest and reinvest. Optional third bucket is a low touch digital asset that you can update monthly in under an hour. Step 2, write the one page playbook that your future tired self can follow. List transfer dates, target percentages, and the only three reasons you are allowed to touch anything. Step 3, set a monthly 30 minute review. Verify transfers, scan fees, check for alerts, then leave it alone.

Use numbers to keep expectations sane. Every 10,000 earning 4 percent pays about 33 per month before tax. A 100 weekly transfer becomes 5,200 a year before market returns. A simple listing that brings 10 sales a month at 9 net per sale is 90 per month, but only if support stays under 30 minutes. If it needs daily messages it is a side job, not passive income.

The mistake I see is chasing higher yield that quietly steals your time. Rentals, niche ads, or complex products can work, but they fail the boredom test for most people without systems or help. There is no shame in lower returns that actually compound while you live your life.

What would pass your boredom test right now, and what part of your current plan would fail the moment you had a chaotic month at work?",moneymakingcow,1,1,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1nfzbts,Partner first prospecting that booked my first meetings,"Cold outreach is crowded. A quieter lane is to win one trusted partner who already serves your ideal clients and make it effortless for them to introduce you. Think accountants, bookkeepers, virtual assistants, photographers, or print shops. They hear about problems before you do and want quick wins for their clients. Here is a simple way to set this up without sounding salesy.

Pick one tiny, low risk offer that complements their work. If your niche is local service businesses, that could be a 90 minute website fix sprint, a menu cleanup, or a Google listing tune up. Package the outcome in one line, set a flat price, and pick a 48 hour turnaround so your partner knows exactly what they are recommending.

Create a partner kit in one sitting. Page 1 is a two paragraph overview in plain language. Page 2 is a 5 question intake your partner can forward. Page 3 is a one page invoice template so payment is clean. Include a simple success metric like bookings in three taps on mobile or page weight reduced by 50 percent. Offer a small referral fee or a swap the first month so there is a reason to try you.

Now run a three day sprint. Day 1, build a list of 25 potential partners and pick the 10 most aligned. Day 2, send a short note that leads with “I help your clients with X, here is the exact outcome in 48 hours, would you be open to a test run with one client this week.” Day 3, follow up with two time options and offer to handle all client comms once introduced. Aim for 2 trial jobs and one ongoing partner. If you price at 150 and share 15 percent, two trials can put 255 in your pocket and open a steady pipeline.

The risk is overpromising and slow delivery. Keep scope tight, communicate fast, and never miss the 48 hour mark. Have you landed clients through partner-first prospecting, and which partner type brought the best introductions in your niche?",Low-Carrot-2167,1,1,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1nflxl6,How AI finds betting discrepancies and turns them into risk-free profits,"Most people think of sports betting as gambling. But this platform I'm working with is very different: AI/machine learning software scans international sportsbooks for betting odd discrepancies — tiny mismatches in pricing between bookmakers. The AI software places bets strategically on both sides of a match/outcome. On average, the system earns around 2-3% per match, betting millions at scale. You don’t place bets yourself — the system does it all, and you simply receive weekly USDT payouts. I joined myself and have been impressed. If you're interested in learning more please message me.

1nfjxng,I used this AI tool to find a winning digital product that made me $367 in a week.,"Hey everyone,

I've been a part of this community for a while now and I've seen so many people struggling to find a winning digital product. I've been there myself. I spent months building products that no one wanted to buy. It was incredibly frustrating and a huge waste of time.

So, I decided to do something different. I built my own AI tool to track digital product trends on platforms like Etsy and Gumroad. I used it for a week, and the results were mind-blowing. It found a new product idea that was starting to go viral, and I decided to build it myself.

I won't bore you with the details, but a week later, I had my first sale. I was shocked. A week after that, I made over $367 from that single product. It was a complete game-changer. I'm no longer guessing, I'm just looking at the data.

I'm not here to sell you anything, I'm here to share what worked for me and to get some feedback from people who know this struggle.

If you'd like to check out the tool, you can join the waitlist here: [**https://whop.com/TrendScope/**](https://whop.com/TrendScope/)

1nf6nu3,I build a pop up label and price tag booth for markets,"Most vendors show up with great products and messy pricing. That gap is your under-the-radar side hustle: an on-site label and mini sign booth at flea markets, craft fairs, and food truck nights. It works because speed matters more than perfection and most sellers do not own a portable label printer. Best for detail-oriented folks with a free Saturday, a small budget, and basic phone design skills. Caveats: some events require permission from the organizer, and rain or wind can slow you down.

**What I offered**

* Quick tag pack: $10 for 20 price labels
* Size set: $12 for 30 garment size dots (S to XXL)
* QR menu cards: $15 for 10 tip jar or menu cards that point to IG, site, or payment
* Barcode batch: $15 for 30 SKUs for inventory apps
* Add ons: $1 per laminated card, $5 custom font/template

**My simple setup**

* Portable thermal label printer and 3 rolls of 1x2 labels — about $85 total
* Mini laminator, 20 sleeves, cardstock, paper cutter — about $35
* Phone with a free QR generator and a basic template app — $0
* Power bank, extension cord, clipboards, tape, alcohol wipes — about $25
* Printed one page menu and a small A-frame sign — about $15 Startup cost target: around $160.

**Workflow**

* Ask 3 questions: prices included, variants, where to point the QR.
* Draft one template on your phone, drop in logo and brand colors.
* Generate QR to Instagram, online shop, or a payment page.
* Print labels, trim cards, and laminate any requested signs.
* Apply a few labels to demonstrate and bag the rest by category.
* Deliver files via Airdrop or email so they can reprint later if needed.

**Numbers**

* 46 conversations, 24 buyers in 4 hours
* 10 Quick tag packs at $10 = $100
* 7 QR menu card sets at $15 = $105
* 6 barcode batches at $15 = $90
* 4 Size sets at $12 = $48
* 5 laminations at $1 = $5
* Total: $348 in a single session

**Lessons learned**

* Non-obvious win: vendors forget signage until showtime, so fast labeling beats fancy design.
* Bring spare rolls and a second power bank to avoid outages.
* Check with the market manager first and set up near the entrance for visibility.

1nf80ei,Is renting weird props and micro spaces locally a good idea?,"Advice seeking from folks who have tried unusual asset rentals. The idea is to rent small, eye catching props and tiny locations to local creators who need short shoots: neon signs, a vintage CRT TV, a fog machine, a rolling garment rack, plus micro spaces like a textured garage wall, colorful hallway, or rooftop corner. It feels underserved because most rental houses are expensive and require full day bookings, while creators often just need one hour and a few props. Best fit seems like people with a creative eye, a garage or spare corner, and a weekend to manage pickups.

My tiny plan is three steps. Step 1: assemble a starter kit for under 250, aim for 5 props that photograph well and survive transport, then do a test shoot to show scale and vibe. Step 2: set simple terms and a deposit, for example 40 per hour for a micro location, 15 to 35 per prop per day, 150 refundable deposit, pickup windows on Sat and Sun, and an ID requirement. Step 3: list inventory and availability in local creator groups and college media clubs, and offer a 99 bundle for two hours plus three props to get the first bookings within two weeks. Rough target is 4 bookings to clear the initial spend.

Risks I see are liability and neighbor issues, plus damage to props. I plan to use a written agreement, require a deposit, set quiet hours, and avoid anything hazardous. For those who have done micro location or prop rentals, how would you handle pricing, deposits, and light insurance, and what prop or space gave you the best return without causing headaches?",moneymakingcow,3,1,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1nf8hrg,Health and safety binder setup for kitchens,"Here is a low key service most small restaurants and food trucks ignore until inspection week. Offer to build and maintain a clean health and safety binder for kitchens: organized SDS sheets for cleaning chemicals, temperature logs for fridges and hot holds, opening and closing checklists, incident and allergen logs, and simple training sign offs. It is non legal, admin focused help that saves managers hours and lowers inspection stress. Underserved because owners juggle staffing and suppliers, not paperwork. Best for organized people who like checklists, have a decent printer and laminator, and can spare a few afternoons.

Tiny plan to start. Step 1: a 60 minute walk through to list chemicals and equipment, snap label photos, and note missing docs. Step 2: assemble a digital folder plus a physical binder with clear tabs: SDS, logs, training, incidents. Print and laminate two daily checklists and generate a QR code that links to the digital copy. Step 3: a 30 minute handoff with the shift lead to explain where everything goes and how to replace sheets weekly. Starter pricing in most cities: 199 for food trucks, 299 to 349 for small restaurants, with an optional 29 to 59 per month checkup for quarterly SDS updates and fresh log packs. First 100 can happen in a week by visiting three kitchens on one street and offering the truck package.

Caveats. You are not giving legal advice and cannot guarantee compliance; you are organizing documents and supplying plain language templates. Local rules vary, so keep scope tight, use official SDS from manufacturers, and get a manager signature at handoff. Consider basic liability insurance and avoid storing sensitive HR information.

1nexj3l,Where should i invest in,"I’m 24 years old, making about **$2,300 per month in South Lebanon** (it will be increasing), and I still live with my parents, so my expenses are pretty low (about 200 to 300$ a month since i pay bills). To give some context: in my area, renting a big 150 m² apartment costs only around **$300–$400/month**, and buying one outright is about **$55k**. For the first three months, my plan is to add to my savings and get a car. After that, I want to start investing: putting around **$500–$600/month into gold**, another **$500–$600/month into Index Fund**, and at the same time paying about **$350/month toward a 30-year loan** for a comfortable house in the **$70k–$90k range at 6% interest**.

So overall, I’ll be paying about **$1,300–$1,600/month** between the apartment loan and investments, and I’ll still have around **$700–$1,000/month in hand**. I plan to save part of that as an emergency fund. For now, I’m not too worried because I have two siblings outside Lebanon who could back me up in case of an emergency, but I’d still like to build my own cushion over time.

Given my current income, expenses, and investment plan, what would you change or add to help me build wealth faster and retire earlier?

I have several degrees and lots of experience. Here is my recipe for easy investing:      \n\n1. Start with ETF\'s.      \n\nI don’t recommend gold, to be honest. You are young so I\'d advice you to select a risky one. My recommendation is QQQ, but you can also go for an all world index fund if you want lower risk. Anything you don’t need in the next 5-10 years should go in there. If you need to set aside money for savings, buy a bond ETF. Savings for a house can be oarked here if you plan on buying within the next 5 years. It doesn\'t matter if you save 5 or 500 every month, as long as you save something. Compound interest can be very powerful. If you want passive income, many very good ETF\'s track strong EU dividend indices. Exx1 and EXSH are very great with decebt growth. Qyld is also great.  \n\n2. Begin learning. Read and listen to anything written or said by Peter lynch. I also recommend william O\'neil and mark minervini.      \n\nYou don’t need to be fluent in accounting, and I don’t think buffets or bogles strategies are optimal for young people like your self. What you need to understand is *why* does a stock have the price it has, and *why* should the price move up or not. It might seem overwhelming and hard to learn this due to the massive amounts of info out there, but if you can get through the writers I\'ve recommended, I guarantee it will start to look a lot easier. Also read the best loser wins by tom hougaard.     \n\n3. Start searching for great companies with growth potential.        \n\nAre they developing new tech? Are they leaders in their field? Are they reinventing the wheel? Why should company A get higher returns than the SP500? Why should company B get better returns than their competitors? Key here is being critical and asking questions. Why, how, what? Never accept info you haven’t considered your self, and be critical of why you believe in a stock or not.      \n\nFrom what I can tell, marketing, business model and how companies use their free cash flow is usually a good indicator for growth. Paying a dividend is usually a good sign, but only if they retain at least 40-60% of their cash flow to invest in the business.    \n\n4. Do not invest money that you can\'t afford to lose in single companies.        \n\nWhile my average return is around 28%, my ""winrate"" is barely above 40. This means I am right only 40 % of the time. But I use risk management principles to not lose money. The best loser wins is a common expression amongtraders and investors for good reason.    \n\nI came from poverty, and started with 10$ a month, sometimes not even that. Now I have two houses, a car, a couple degrees and I can basicly retire by 40 if I want. The hard part about financial freedom is not learning to invest, but to be patient and to control your risk and psychology.       \n\nSlowly shifting towards a dividend oriented portfolio or an income-focused strategy as you get closer to your goal might help boost your income and let you retire early.        \n\nLook into your countries tax and investing laws before you start investing with serious money.

1nf7kk8,I tried making money with Ezoic and Monumetric and it worked,"I'll start by saying that I love earning passive income through ads. It's really passive, you just create a platfrom and earn for every single view you receive. I never entered my blog in adsense (because I wasn't accepted) but that gave me the option to look somewhere else. Initially, when I first got to 10k monthly views I finally entered Ezoic and it was an adventure. But I tried. For days. It was nerve-wracking trying to figure out what to put where and all the names and codes to enter through WordPress, Siteground and Ezoic. But finally I did it.

And I nearly had a heart attack.

I had already written about 50 articles and spent months working on this blog. And from one second to the next, it was all gone. It wouldn’t let me in, but it wasn’t just that. When I googled my URL, nothing would come up. And that day Ezoic didn’t respond to my call for help so I shut everything down and didn’t look back.

Then I tried Monumetric, after a while, and finally started seeing real money in my bank account. If you want to see how much you could take a look at this article. [https://iinkonscreen.com/monumetric-review-my-honest-experience/](https://iinkonscreen.com/monumetric-review-my-honest-experience/)

I’ve tried different strategies (content, ads, social media, etc.), but nothing seems to stick, and it feels like I’m just spinning my wheels.

If you’ve managed to profit from online marketing, how did you get there? What was the turning point for you?

I am still going through my ""Anerkennungs"" Process for which I still need to give 3 exams after which I need to work 2 years as an Junior Dentist to get my Kassenzulassung and then I can open my own clinic.
I have three youtube channels, one of them is monetized (but earning is negligible because I wasn't active that much)  one of them is recently made in German language and one is just for my home country.
I also have two websites, both with content writers writing content for me, but in initial phases.
I invest my earning in stocks, crypto and gold etc.

I want to know, how can one be a millionaire, or a multi millionaire in Germany? I am ready to give my all. Work myself off for next 10 15 years to then retire early by 45 or 50, or work only because I want to. To have that financial freedom.
I work 8 hours, and then come home, study, shoot videos, edit, and develop my next project. 
But I still don't have a proper road map of how can I become a multi millionaire in Germany. I don't have plans of opening my own clinic as after looking at the situation of current employees and youngsters (how frequently they take krank etc) I am very afraid of getting myself more deeper into trouble.

So im 23 and I came to the realization that im going to be stuck working 40+ hour jobs for the rest of my life if i dont do something now. 

 I live paycheck to paycheck and I’m so tired of working a 9-5 when I see so many of my apartment neighbors either at home most of the week, or have very short work days, always off on all the holidays and the week of the holiday.

I feel like I have to be missing out on knowing the right information so I can also live a life style that isn’t so stressful and can actually bring me to a place in life that I would enjoy. Been working since I was 16 so I’m definitely getting tired of the workforce already

1newyvh,3 Passive Income Hacks (That Actually Work),"Look. Let's be frank. In order to create passive income you need to invest in ONE of the two options:

**TIME** (building something) or **MONEY** (investing.)

I know there are many people here looking for magic passive income to fall from the sky. Good luck if that happens, but don't expect it. (And if you do get lucky, it will be just a trickle not a real stream.)

So if that's what you're looking for, skip this post.

If you really want to create some passive income, here are **THREE** things that have worked for me.

I had a paradigm shift: Stop chasing one-time commissions. And work with focus and intensity on something that has potential.

So, with that in mind, here's how to build real passive income with recurring affiliate programs:

**1. Target SaaS with monthly subscriptions** Find software that bills monthly/yearly and pays lifetime commissions. A single $50/month customer = $600+ per year in your pocket. Tools like ConvertKit, Semrush, or Canva Pro keep paying as long as they stay subscribed.

DM me and ask for my ""#1 recurring software affiliate program"" if interested. I don't think we can post affiliate links here.

**2. Build a software directory in your niche** Create a comprehensive resource listing all tools in your specialty (project management for solopreneurs, AI podcasting tools, email marketing platforms, etc). It has to be hyper-specific. I put together a more detailed guide on [how I personally create these types of sites here](https://www.digitalabc.net/directory?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=passiveincome&utm_campaign=3tipsaf). Optimize for SEO, add genuine VALUE in your posts, and monetize with affiliate links. 

Directory sites have GREAT interlinking and Google is loving them because it's clear what the site is about. It's a myth they don't rank new sites. They play with their rankings and will give you traffic. People searching for ""best \[niche\] software"" will find you organically for years.

**3. Create evergreen tutorial content** Make step-by-step guides showing how to solve common problems using your affiliate tools. YouTube videos, blog posts, or courses that teach while they sell. The content works 24/7 once published.

You can also republish these on your directory.

The key: Pick one narrow niche, become the go-to resource, then let compounding, recurring traffic do the heavy lifting.

It takes some work, but it is so worth it!

I bet on **basketball player props**, but every tool I found only covered the NBA. Nothing existed for **EuroLeague or European domestic leagues**, which I also follow. So I built my own dashboard — and called it **Oddsballer**.

What it does:

* Tracks **player prop hit rates** (points, rebounds, assists)
* Shows **stats & trends** over recent games
* Compares bookmaker lines with actual performance

1ne4z5j,How I got from $0 to $100 to $1000 and a consistent $1000+/month in passive income from digital products,"
I eventually made over $300k from this digital products business, including over $180k in one year alone but I guess ironically smaller numbers are more ""believable"", especially if someone hasn't made their first dollar online.

The thing about a digital products business is that it does have the ability to generate nice passive income, however, setting up the intial foundation takes work.

This post breaks down the evergreen foundation that worked for me not just once but now 2 more times.

If you're looking for a get rich thing that you can spin up instantly, this is not it.

However, if you want a deep case study from someone who didn't just shill products but built a mini media empire, an online money asset that was able to be sold and attracted passive income from ads and sponsorships on top of digital products, you're in the right spot.

For those of you that have the patience and bandwidth to read both this post and the whole free preview of my case study (even this is extensive), you're already ahead of probably 90%+ of readers on this sub.

Enough rambling, here are the top 3 things I did to make my first $100, $1000, and $1000/month:

I will keep this as short as I can for Reddit standards while still offering as much value as I can (I will reply to comments too):

*First $100:*
I tested on forums with a landing page, before I even put in time and effort to make a website. 

*First $1000:*
Ended up making over $400 during the first test in less than 10 days. I then went on to create a Udemy course on the topic, which eventually went on to make over $600.

During this phase, since my proof of concept was there, I threw up my website, which was simply a sales page (although I used a proprietary framework to make sure it would sell).

I also started consistently posting videos on a YouTube channel, with a CTA to buy my guide. This generated some steady sales.

*First consistent $1000/month*
$1000/month is a big milestone. While I could've gotten here on my own eventually, I leveraged reach with some publicity thanks to successful outreach.

The sales during this time were also pretty much completely passive income: although I was doing work, I was basically just planting seeds for future income while reaping the rewards of what I had built previously. I also took a 10 day vacation during this time, did 0 work, and made almost $400 from my digital products.

Long story short, to get to this phase, I sent an email, got featured on a popular site's mailing list, and made roughly $300 in 24 hours after my feature went live. I include the full outreach email, a breakdown of why it worked, and the subsequent steps that led to making $300 and then $1000+/month consistently as a result.

Starting out on your own organically and bootstrapped with very little money can prove tough, so take advantage of press to get your story out there.

However, in order to get press, you need to gain expertise in your topic.

Thankfully, you can learn how to do pretty much anything today, and in order to create and sell a digital product with authority, sometimes you just need to be a few steps ahead of your customers. 

This might mean just a few deep hours per week of research and practice before you gain the experience to create and sell a digital product on the niche.

On your spare time learn new skills either online or physically. When I was 19 I immigrated in the US with just $500, I worked at a restaurant and ate even people’s left over, I saved every money I had, then I watched some YouTube video how to do landscaping and painting.

And don’t get stuck, always think of new opportunities, while you are working at a low paying job, look for higher paying job in your area.

1neciq4,I used this AI tool to find a winning digital product that made me $78 in one day.,"Hey everyone,

I've been a part of this community for a while now, and I've seen so many posts about people struggling to create passive income streams. I've been there myself. I tried building several digital products, but I kept running into the same problem: a lack of demand. It's like building a beautiful house in the middle of nowhere.

After months of frustration, I realized the problem wasn't my skills, but my process. I wasn't finding products people actually wanted to buy. I wasn't focusing on trends, I was just guessing. So, I decided to do something different.

I built an AI tool to track real-time trends on platforms like Etsy and Gumroad. It's like having a 24/7 radar that sends me alerts every time a new digital product starts getting a lot of attention. I can see what's selling now, not what sold a month ago.

The results have been a complete game-changer. I'm no longer guessing, I'm just looking at the data. I'm not here to sell you anything, I'm here to share what worked for me and to get some feedback from people who know this struggle.

1ndflv8,How a 30-second read turned into thousands of views,"I never really thought of Medium as passive, but once I figured out how the system works, it started to feel that way.

What I learned is this: every new post only goes out to around 10–30 people. If they bounce in under 30 seconds, the post dies there. But if they keep reading, Medium starts showing it to more people. That’s when things can snowball without you doing anything extra.

So I changed my routine. Instead of blasting out a bunch of half-finished posts, I wrote one or two a day. I kept it first person, shared real experiences, and dropped in screenshots so readers knew I wasn’t just making things up. Posting regularly seemed to help too.

After a couple weeks, some posts finally held people past that 30-second mark. They started reaching thousands of readers. Even months later, those same posts still show up and keep pulling in views and follows, even though I haven’t touched them.

It’s not life-changing money, but steady traffic like that gives me options. I can send it to a blog, a product page, or just let the ad revenue trickle in.

I’m focusing on affiliate marketing because it’s scalable and passive. Here’s my lineup:

* High-Ticket Affiliate: Promote SaaS/AI tools, earning $500-1,450 per commission. Start by picking a niche you’re passionate about (e.g., AI content) and use AI to generate content quickly.
* Digital Products + Affiliate: Sell ebooks/templates with embedded affiliate links, earning recurring income from old links (hundreds of dollars per month without touching them).
* Amazon Reviews/TikTok Shop: Create video reviews (faceless with AI), earning from views and buys. Just started, but making $50-80 per week if I post consistently.

Effective tips: Build an audience on X/LinkedIn and automate with tools like Affitor (helps with offer matching). I’m earning four figures per month from digital publishing combined with affiliate marketing.

1ne1f63,The things that I did and still doing for my business to become successful and the lessons I learned along the way.,"I am 21M trying to find a way to make my ecom business successful. 

I was 19 when I was searching for different business ideas and many came into my mind and I don't remember what were they.

I used to search on YouTube about how to make money online and tons of videos came saying do this do that and one thing that I remember is creating books and selling it on Amazon, So I created one storybook, generated images with AI and published it and I thought that I would get sales cause in the video the dude said I would make sales. 

And of course it failed, I didn't get a dime. 

I understood that this wasn't my field, so I backed out of that business idea. 

Then many videos came onto my Instagram and YouTube feed about dropshipping and many guys putting reels saying how they made their millions doing dropshipping. 

I became 20M

I didn't know what dropshipping was at that time and then I understood that it is a type of ecommerce. Then the next thing came called Print on demand. 

I decided to give it a try and to do that I need an online store and when I searched for it every reel said go to shopify and create one. 

That's the first time I knew about Shopify. 

I made a plan about selling Print on Demand Tshirts. So I created a shopify store for it. I watched a free dropshipping course of Jordan Brown and made that store, created a brand name, created a logo blah blah blah.

I launched my store, I didn't know about SEO and other stuff. I just posted reels and shorts on YT and Instagram. I didn't have money for doing ads.

I didn't even had money for running this shopify store, my mother gave me money. 

I ran it for 3 months and didn't get any sales, I lost about 8K running that shopify store. I realised that if I continue to run this store I will waste my mother's money, so I closed it. 

Now all I have is that brand name and the dot com domain.

I understood that Print on Demand and Dropshipping aint gonna work out for me.

I started to think about doing Ecommerce, so that I can sell the products to people for a lower price and I can put a competitive price in my products compared to Amazon and Flipkart so that people can buy from my store like they purchase from Amazon, Flipkart etc. 

I decided to do ecommerce and I turned 21M.

So Ecommerce fixed, now what I need is an ecom store. I thought about shopify and I realised what happened last time losing 8K and instantly in my mind ""HELL NO I ain't gonna run shopify again"" 
Shopify is ₹2350 a month including taxes and I can't afford that, I am not going for work, I was a student and I live at my parents expenses so I never wanted to waste their money. 

I thought about building a store myself, I know programming, I searched for youtube tutorials about building an ecommerce website and I found many but They were just a waste of time cause the store they make for tutorials only works if the payment gateway is Stripe. 

In India we don't have Stripe (I don't know about now but at that time to create a Stripe account we need to have an invitation or something and we should have a business email). 

So I dropped that idea. 

Finally after a long time I developed a fully functional, production ready Ecommerce store myself, gave it my old brand name and launched it on my domain.

Now the store is set, I don't have to pay 
₹2350/month now for shopify store, I only have to pay ₹700/month for the backend and I only have to  start paying that when I decide to enable the ""Buy Now / Checkout"" button, until then I can run my website for free. 

Now what I need are the products to sell, I chose to sell some useful products like gadgets and other stuff, currently my plan is to sell useful products like some gadgets, appliances, home furnishing products etc

I learnd some things from the failure of my old store, so I did SEO and I am trying to develop my SEO everyday. 

I told the suppliers that I am running an ecommerce store and I will order from you when I get the orders on my store and they said Okay. 

I got my first sale, and I went to the supplier and told them that I need this product and they said NO and I should buy from them at a minimum value of ₹5000, most of the suppliers said the exact same thing. 

So I told one of them that they said they also support dropshipping model and it is clear in their message, and they told me that they don't support dropshipping model now. 

I told them that this is my first sale and I will order more from them in the coming days and they said NO. 

I had no choice, I backed off, I refunded the customers their money and shut down the buy now option. 

This time I learned a lesson that if you're gonna do an Ecommerce business, you need to have the products with you, otherwise don't even start it. 

Not in bulk, atleast you should have 5 or 6 something quantity for each product that you plan to sell. 

Now I am trying to find a way how to make some money to get those products and reopen my store. 

I am still 21M, turning 22M next month.

I will start it soon, within the next month.

1ndeoyv,I left this project on my laptop for 1 year. Today I tried again… and it worked!,"last year, in **july 2024**,  i started a small project, i wanted to make a tool that can generate kids stories with consistent characters. the problem was always the same, when i put multiple characters in the prompt it gets messy and the story lose track. so i left it on my laptop and forgot.

today **september 2025** i opened it again because nano banana launched. i gave it a try… and it just worked!

[example images I generated today](https://preview.redd.it/5hp9fkbuccof1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=01b847741a592bd4ccd4458b77d31051835a1789)

Now, in minutes, I can generate all the images for the stories I write.

seems a great micro-SaaS idea.i know there are already some tools like it, but the simplicity and the way I approached it makes me think it’s worth building. I already run 6+ projects online, so I’m not sure if I’ll launch this one too. But I wanted to share — maybe someone here will grab the idea and run with it.

the point is don’t just play with models, try to think how to use them to solve real problems.

P.S. I homeschool my kid — that’s why I got the idea of writing stories in the first place. I’ll be publishing some of these books soon, mainly for my son.

P.P.S. If anyone wants the prototype project, just say so in the comments. I’m not sure if sharing direct links is allowed here.

P.P.P.S, the images you see are from a story i’m writing, it’s about teaching quantum concepts to kids in an interesting way. i’m saying this because sometimes a unique idea can really make a difference, don’t just copy others.",Lazy_Economy_6851,31,60,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

* use a quick ai tool (like hypecaster or capcut)
* mix in some simple formats like text hooks, memes, and trending sounds
* post 1–2 times a day, no hashtags, no hacks, just morning and evening uploads

after a week or so the views start climbing

1ndvkxq,Missed calls were quietly costing my clients £££ — here’s how we fixed it,"A few months ago, I noticed a painful pattern with a couple of my service business clients (roofers, contractors, that sort of space):

They were doing great work, had solid reputations… but they were missing calls. And in this industry, if you miss a call, that job is gone — customers rarely call back.

So I decided to fix it.

Here’s what we built:
	•	A simple system that logs every lead into a CRM automatically
	•	A no-back-and-forth booking link (customers just pick a time)
	•	Automated follow-ups so no enquiry slips through
	•	A dashboard so the owner can see calls, enquiries, and booked jobs in real time

The difference has been huge — clients went from chasing missed calls manually to getting 2–3+ extra booked jobs a month on autopilot.

I’m curious — how are you all handling missed calls or follow-ups in your businesses? Do you have a system, or is it still manual?

1ndqitm,Has anyone here tried publishing eBooks as a passive income source?,"Hey folks 👋

I’ve been playing around with AI tools like ChatGPT and MidJourney, and ended up turning my notes into a small eBook. It’s my first attempt at creating a digital product that could generate some passive income.

Right now I’m not sure how well it will work, but I’m proud I finished and published it.

Has anyone else here tried ebooks as a passive income source? Would love to hear your experience 🙌

1ndkq1p,"Selling Weekly ""Lottos"" - Week 13 - $1049 Income using $79,000 Collateral.","Seems like its not allowed to post multiple images on this sub anymore so here is a link to the proof of trades and my spreadsheet.


https://imgur.com/a/abaQvz2


Every week I sell the equivalent of lottery tickets to gamblers in the stock market using options.


1. Everything I have is covered, meaning I have the cash and shares, and I don't use margin. 
2. I am happy to buy or sell the shares at those prices in this timeframe. 
3. Its not free money, all investing carries the risk of losses. I am being paid for this risk, usually.


-


This weeks winner: Me. I won 3 out of 3 contracts.


Total income made was $1049 using $79,000 worth of collateral for a 1.32% yield. This took about 15 minutes of logging in and selling to open then buying to close the contracts.


Closed positions:


BITX 65 Call x5: Sold for $431 and bought back for $10. Total $421 profit using $32,500 worth of shares.


BITX 53 Put x5:  Sold for $546 and bought back for $265. Total $281 profit using $26,500 worth of cash.


HOOD 100 Put x2: Sold for $604 bought back for $257. Total $347 profit using $20,000 worth of cash.


-


After 3 months I have made almost $17,000 using an average of just over $130,000. This comes out to almost $1300 per week at just barely below 1% weekly yield.


If I can continue at this rate, the annualized income will be around $67,000 at an estimated annual yield of 51.5%.


I think this is a solid strategy for passive income, but because the market is still on easy mode I will wait to come to a definite conclusion if these results are sustainable through a market correction, especially a long term one.


-


In order to start this you'll have to have either 100 shares of a stock which has options available, or enough cash to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price, or both.


If you have these, you can choose to sell a covered call and/or cash secured put by going to the options section and selecting ""Sell"" or ""Sell to Open"" on the specific strike price and expiration date. You will need to type in the price you want to sell them for, which is usually shown at the current price, but you can do a limit order for another price similar to stocks.

 
This will take you from having 0 contracts to have a negative number of contracts. Buying back the contract or letting it expire will bring you back to zero contracts, which would be the trade. This is the reverse of normal buying first and then selling to close the position.


You can also be assigned if the stock goes past your strike price. In that case the shares will be taken from you or you will be forced to buy them at the strike price you agreed to. You will still receive the full premium for how much you sold it for which is added to the cost basis of the shares you sell, or subtracted from what you buy.


Lastly, the best part about this is that options at some point expire. So you can also just do nothing and it will potentially expire worthless, which will automatically close the position for you at max profit as the seller. This is the core aspect of this strategy and the reason I think its such a strong way to make gains.

1ndqi4o,The #1 reason most people never see real passive income,"I’ve been through the same cycle I see here all the time: trying 5 different “passive” income streams at once, burning out, and calling it a scam.

The reality? Passive income isn’t *passive* at the start. You need to front-load the work, then build systems that let it run without you.

Here’s what actually worked for me:

* **Affiliate marketing** → recurring commissions from tools I already use.
* **Freelancing → productization** → I started with client work, then packaged my process into templates. That shifted it into semi-passive income.
* **Digital products** → one-time creation, infinite sales.
* **Content + email list** → the “engine” that makes all of the above sustainable.

The mistake most beginners make is chasing shiny objects. The people who actually win? They commit to *one model for 90 days* and build simple systems around it before layering in more streams.

I put together a complete roadmap around this process—it’s at [flowfoundryai.com](https://flowfoundryai.com/) (⚠️ this is my own resource, not an affiliate link). It’s basically everything I wish I had on day one.

Curious—how do you approach it? Do you stack multiple streams right away, or focus on one until it pays consistently?",kamikazedce,1,0,[]

1ndls21,My recently found side hustle that my gf doesn’t know about,"I’m missing 3 toes my middle my ring and pinky toe from an accident that left me in a medically induced coma. and now I make 1,500-2,200 a month. Some months I make nothing and one month (my highest paying month) I made a little over 5,000$. There r some weirdo creeps out there. Fr fr. Other guys I heard put whip cream and Carmel chocolate sauce on their feet for the “foodies” but hey… don’t judge me.

I’ve been in a three year relationship with my gf. And only now after being on Reddit and reading the thing that I follow on here am I considering telling her. Well actually I feel guilty because I have been lying to her and she thinks the money I get every month is from my settlement due to the accident. Which I may plan on expanding on later. But yea… idk what to do. I’m perfectly capable and comfortable with just continuing on the way things have been going. And I don’t think she will be mad at me if I do tell her. Well maybe for the lying part. I mean… like I did confess to her I still have a hole from a dick piercing I got on a drunk night out in college and she didn’t seem to judge me on that. The way I tested the waters was by saying to her, “don’t you think that guys who get dick piercings are weirdo’s and I asked if she knew anyone with one and did she think so too?” She said something like nope and no i don’t know anyone. Then I said well you know one. And she was like no I don’t. Then I. Said, “yes you do silly, you know me!” Hahaha then later on when she didn’t believe me I took a paperclip and put it through the hole and was like, “see!!! I wasn’t lying.” She still didn’t believe me until like the second time I did it or maybe when she was giving me a bj amd I tl]old her to look for the hole. Now everytime when she does it she like tries putting her tongue through it. P.s it’s a piercing that’s on the bottom not the top or through the head. I didn’t learn about the different places you could get a dick piercing until I was watching that show called “you” on Netflix. And in one of the scenes a dead guys body is shown and he has a piercing through the top on the head of his dick. Eeewwww right. I know I cringe even thinking about it. I’m just glad that when I got mine it wasn’t there. Because I can’t remember a damn thing about that night. Not who I was with or where or who was with me. My friends had to tell me the next day and then again after I woke up from my coma because I forgot that even happened. Whew wow that post went on much longer than I planned. Lmao

1ncql2n,Is it possible to achieve wealth without a corporate job?,"I’m 23 and have been working corporate jobs for 2 years now. I absolutely hate it and can’t see myself doing this for 40 more years. My current job is remote which helps but I still can’t stand the bureaucracy and the nature of the work I do.

I’ve noticed a lot of people here say “all ebooks are just about making money, so they must be a scam.”

That’s actually the wrong way to look at it. The only reason you mostly see those ebooks on Reddit is because of where they naturally fit in the marketing world.
 Think about it:
Recipe ebooks blow up on TikTok.

Workout programs dominate Instagram.

B2B marketing ideas get shared on LinkedIn or niche subs.

And yes, “make money” ebooks show up on Reddit, because this is where side hustlers and income seekers hang out.

Im a normal average guy, had  education, from europe. Im married and life is getting more and more expensive however i have zero to no monetary education and because of my education i grew up to want basically nothing. i dont buy basically anyting for myself and i dont see adds or find any meaning in things like ads or stuff that is trends. 

I dont understand how can i make money online when i personally wouldnt buy anything.

  
In a sense i dont know how to generate value because there is no value in anything online that i would personally would spend money in and therefore i cant understand how to make money because i don't understand why people would spend a single coin .

I'm a designer and work in digital marketing. So I'm already very familiar with typical online businesses, but I've never started a digital side hustle or passive income on my own.

I would now like to start doing so and create digital assets such as guides and distribute them via Etsy or Gumroad. I already found my niche: I want to distribute helpful information about a niche hobby of mine for a few dollars.

However, I am currently thinking a lot about the top of the funnel, i.e., where the traffic comes from. I would like to start lean without paid assets but build organic traffic. I was thinking of using Pinterest and Instagram intensively.

Do you have any other traffic channel ideas or more specific tips on how you would proceed on these platforms? What next steps would you take as far the guide is finished?

1nd99nk,"Made my first online money with a $25 product (not even mine), here's how so you can do it too.","Okay, so i finally did it. I made my first money online and not from surveys, not from dropshipping, not for selling my soul for $2/hr.

Here's what i did:

So i promoted a legit digital guide called ""puppy house training in 14 days"" a 42-page step by step training system for new puppy owners.

This thing actually sells because pet owners spend $$$ (i tried  it myself).

But there's an issue you cannot join affiliate program directly through gumroad. I reached out the owner itself cause i found it really interesting and i got an affiliate link. But here's the cool part i can help you join (for free). 

Perks of joining this affiliate program:

• 30% commission per sale that is $7.5 per sale.

•access to a private affiliate community (daily tips + marketing strategies).

•A done for you product info pack + promo strategy to start selling instantly.

•BONUS : if you hit 10 sales in a month, your commission jumps tp 40% ($10 per sale).

But you might think why i am sharing this ? This is because i know how frustating it is to keep trying random ""make money online"" stuff that never works. This is simple you promote a product that solves real problem. 

I started promoting it for like 2 weeks now and already got 3 sales. I thought it would be cool to share with people who needed it.

If you want in, just DM me. I'll walk you through joining the affiliate program and getting you community access, link and bonuses.",PlatformGlittering57,1,0,[]
1ndgtuv,I used this AI tool to find a winning digital product that made me $423 in a week.,"Hey everyone,

I've been a part of this community for a while now and I've seen so many people struggling to find a winning digital product. I've been there myself. I spent months building products that no one wanted to buy. It was incredibly frustrating and a huge waste of time.

So, I decided to do something different. I built my own AI tool to track digital product trends on platforms like Etsy and Gumroad. I used it for a week, and the results were mind-blowing. It found a new product idea that was starting to go viral, and I decided to build it myself.

I won't bore you with the details, but a week later, I had my first sale. I was shocked. A week after that, I made over $423 from that single product. It was a complete game-changer. I'm no longer guessing, I'm just looking at the data.

I'm not here to sell you anything, I'm here to share what worked for me and to get some feedback from people who know this struggle.

If you'd like to check out the tool, you can join the waitlist here: [**https://whop.com/TrendScope/**](https://whop.com/TrendScope/)

1nd94bh,What counts as passive income in real life,"We throw the term around a lot, but what actually qualifies as passive when you still have a day job and a life. My working definition is simple: if it earns while you sleep and needs under two hours a month to maintain, it is passive. Everything else is a side job in disguise.

Here is how the math looks to me. Cash-like yield at 4 to 5 percent is boring but real. On $10,000 that is about $33 to $41 per month before tax with near zero effort. Broad dividend funds yield around 1.5 to 3 percent, which is $12 to $25 per month per $10,000 if you take payouts, or an invisible drip if you reinvest. Rentals can produce $200 to $400 net per door, but only if you have solid management and reserves, and even then tenant turns or repairs can eat your month. Digital assets like a small template pack or photo set can pay for months, but the honest version needs a few hours per month for light updates and support.

A test I like uses three questions. Setup hours: can you finish it in a weekend. Maintenance minutes: can you keep it alive in two one hour blocks per month. Distribution that compounds: does it have an automatic way for new money to find it, like a scheduled transfer, a marketplace search page, or a simple listing. If any one answer is no, it is probably semi passive at best.

A simple stack that passes the test looks like this. Keep three months of expenses in a high yield account. Automate a transfer into that account every payday. Automate a second transfer into a low fee index fund and enroll in reinvestment. If you want a small third stream, add one low touch digital asset that you can update monthly in under an hour. Put a single reminder on your calendar to check fees, transfers, and any unanswered messages on the first Saturday of each month.

The debate I want to have is about tradeoffs. Is it better to chase higher yield that needs attention, like rentals or niche digital assets, or accept lower yield that is truly hands off, like cash yield and broad funds. If you had to build a passive stack that you could ignore for 90 days, what would be in it and why?",Carftgineer,1,8,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1nd8y4b,How i made 1350 dollars in 9 days,"I achieved $1,350 in 9 days with a simple freelancing method: a 90 minute ""website fix sprint"" for local service businesses. The outcome was clear and easy to buy. I would remove two friction points on the site, tighten the above the fold copy, and make the booking or call action obvious on mobile. Flat price was $225, 48 hour turnaround, one revision included.

Step 1 was packaging. I wrote a one sentence promise that anyone could understand: ""I will make it take 3 taps to book you from a phone."" I set scope rules so I could finish in one sitting: no new pages, no platform migrations, just layout, copy, buttons, and basic form settings.

Step 2 was targeting. I pulled 70 prospects within 15 km by searching for coaches, salons, and trades. I kept only the 50 that showed two signals in 30 seconds or less: booking link hidden, more than 4 clicks to contact, or tiny text above the fold. I found owner names on an about page or social bio.

Step 3 was the message. I sent a 4 line email between 8 and 10 am local time. Line 1 named the visible issue on their site. Line 2 stated my outcome and deadline. Line 3 gave the flat price. Line 4 offered two time slots or the option to skip a call and send the link. No attachments. I followed up once at 48 hours with a single sentence and fresh time slots.

Numbers in 9 days: 50 sent, 14 replies, 8 yes or maybe, 7 links received, 6 paid, 1 postponed. Delivery took 70 to 90 minutes each: map current path to book, reduce steps to 3, rewrite buttons and headline in plain language, fix mobile spacing, test and send a short note with what changed. Revenue was $1,350 for about 10.5 hours of work. The biggest lever was naming the exact friction I saw in line one. The mistake on day one was sending long messages. Plain text under 400 characters worked best.

Lesson learned: a tiny, outcome based offer that can be delivered fast beats a broad pitch almost every time. If you had to ship a 90 minute micro offer in your niche this week, what specific problem would you fix and what first line would you write to get the reply?",Low-Carrot-2167,1,0,[]
1nd8k67,Protecting builder time when you have a job,"Most side hustles die from random interruptions, not lack of ideas. The fix is to treat your week like two schedules: a short “manager” window for messages and admin, and two “builder” blocks where you only ship work. You do not need 20 hours. You need two 90 minute builder blocks and three 20 minute manager windows.

Step 1: pick two concrete builder slots you can repeat, like Tue 19:30 and Thu 19:30. Put them on a shared calendar and tell anyone who needs to know that you are unavailable in those windows.

Step 2: define one shippable outcome per builder slot. Examples: deliver 10 captions, edit a 60 second video, clean one spreadsheet, send 15 targeted pitches. If the outcome does not fit in 90 minutes, you have picked the wrong outcome.

Step 3: guard the slots. Phone on airplane mode, desktop notifications off, one tab open. If something urgent arrives, move the whole block within 24 hours or it expires. No splitting.

Step 4: prep the night before in 10 minutes. Open the exact file, paste your template, write three sub steps, and stage assets so you can start in 60 seconds.

Step 5: track a simple scoreboard. Planned minutes vs actual, outcomes shipped, replies received, euros booked. If a slot produces nothing twice, change the time of day or shrink the outcome.

This rhythm is boring on purpose, which is why it works with a full time job.

1nd6ixn,Passive income through TXC mining share,"In January this year I bought mining shares for Texitcoin. It was ~ $0.10 per coin when I bought the shares, and as of writing this post it is now $3.12 per coin. 

If you go on their site they give an overview of the mission and how mining shares work. Essentially with the mining shares, you get a payout of TXC from the mine every day. You also get compensation for recruiting new miners. 

I haven’t gotten any recruits - I have actually been very passive since buying the shares, lol - and have already gotten 5x return on my initial investment and it’s only been 8 months or so. I expect the return to increase as the value of TXC goes up and I continue to get shares from the mine. I also hope to start making commission from recruiting, hence this post 😅

For the skeptics, I’ve taken out ~$1000 in cash from my TXC to show that this is legit. To take out my cash I went from my TXC wallet -> Dextrade -> Coinbase -> my bank. It’s actually quite straightforward. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

1nbqgs0,I made $0 for 3 years because I was hiding from the only skill that actually mattered.,"2013: Built a website. A classified ads site for Udemy courses.  
Coded every line myself.  
Launch day visitors: Zero.

2015: Built IT admin tools. Actually useful. Used them at my job.  
Sales: Zero.

2016: Quit my job with 1 year of savings. (Don't do this)  
Income: Still zero.

You know what all these had in common?  
I was terrified of marketing.

Here's the truth nobody tells you:  
You can build the most beautiful product on Earth.  
Nobody cares if they don't know it exists.  
Marketing is 80% of any business.  
Product is 20%.  
I had it completely backwards.

The $12 that changed everything!

2017: Finally recorded my first course.  
30 minutes. Voice only. Quality was garbage.  
I was Too shy to show my face.  
But the topic had zero competition on Udemy (*Topic: IIS Web Server*)  
First sale: $12.  
That notification hit different.  
Not because of the money.  
Because someone, somewhere, found value in what I created.

Here's what actually worked:  
Started a YouTube channel.  
One video.  
Ranked #1  
Hit $300/month.  
Then I did the dumbest thing possible...  
I tried to build everything at once  
H-educate (now LearnWithHasan) - jumped between:

Email marketing, Make money online, Affiliate Marketing, Mining...  
Whatever was trending

Guess what happened?  
Nothing stuck.  
I was trying to juggle 10 balls when I couldn't hold one.

The lesson that made me profitable:  
FOCUS ON ONE PROJECT AT A TIME.

Get it to $1k/month (at least)  
Then move to the next.  
Sounds simple?  
It is.

But your brain will fight you.  
""What if this other idea is better?""  
""What if I'm missing out?""  
""What if someone else does it first?""  
Fight back.

But here's the thing...  
I'm not a millionaire.  
No Lamborghini.  
No ""quit your job in 30 days"" BS.  
Just stable income doing what I love.

Most of you reading this are better developers than me.

More talented than me.

But you're making the same mistake I did:  
Hiding behind your keyboard.  
Perfecting your code.  
Avoiding the one thing that matters.  
Telling people you exist.

Stop waiting for:  
The perfect product  
The perfect timing  
The perfect audience  
The perfect anything

Start with:  
One terrible product  
One awkward post  
One bad video  
One embarrassing launch

My first everything was garbage.  
Yours will be too.  
That's the point.

The real difference between you and successful builders?  
They shipped their garbage.  
You're still polishing yours.  
Here's what you do TODAY:

Pick ONE project (not three, ONE)  
Build the most basic version possible  
Tell 10 people about it  
Get rejected by 9  
Learn from the 1 who cared  
Repeat tomorrow

No courses needed.  
No masterminds.  
No morning routines.  
Just build, share, learn, repeat.

The best part?  
You don't need 11 years like I did.  
With AI today, you can do in months what took me years.

I built SimplerLLM in 2 weeks.  
Already helping thousands.

The game has changed.  
But the rules haven't:  
Stop building in secret.  
Start selling in public.  
Even if it's terrible.  
Especially if it's terrible.  
Because that first $12?  
It's not about the money.  
It's about proving you can.  
And once you prove you can make $12...  
$120 is just repetition.  
$1,200 is just scale.  
$12,000 is just systems.  
But $0?  
$0 is just fear.  
Stop being 2013 me.  
Start being the you who ships today.

Currently building project #10 and still scared every launch.

1nca19y,I started working hard on what comes easy,"James Clear (author of *Atomic Habits*) once said: *“Work hard on what comes easily.”*

That line really stuck with me. Every day I see a ton of passive income ideas, and it’s easy to get caught chasing things I don’t really understand. But I realized that when I force myself into something new just because it looks shiny, I burn out.

So instead, I’ve doubled down on the things that come naturally to me—creating and publishing books, making YouTube videos, and building digital products.

Funny enough, working harder on what feels easy has been the most sustainable approach for me.

1ncop2y,Is a $35 trial better than a portfolio for new freelancers?,"Discussion: portfolios rarely fix the client’s real problem, which is risk. A buyer cares less about your five best projects and more about one proof you can help them by tomorrow. For brand new freelancers, a tiny paid trial can outperform a static portfolio because it shifts the decision from “do I believe this person” to “do I want this quick win for a small cost.”

Here’s a simple structure to test:

1. Pick one outcome buyers already want, like “rewrite a headline for higher clarity” or “deliver three clean product photos.”
2. Promise a 24 hour turnaround and price the trial at $25 to $45.
3. Describe the deliverable in one sentence and show a before and after sample in the message.
4. Ask a yes or no question to book a 10 minute call.
5. Follow up on day 3 with a new angle and day 7 with a soft close.

Why this can work: it lowers friction, creates a deadline, and gives the buyer a safe way to test you. Many beginners spend 20 to 40 hours building a site and still hear nothing. Ten targeted messages with a concrete 24 hour offer often return replies in days, not weeks.

Objections worth debating:

* “Cheap trials anchor low prices.” Counter: cap scope, set a clear upgrade at $120 to $180, and expire the trial after the first week.
* “It attracts bad clients.” Counter: define exactly what is included, deliver fast, and move on if the fit is poor.
* “I need a portfolio for credibility.” Counter: a single visible win delivered in one day becomes your first case study.

Ethics matter. Trials should be real value, not bait. Be explicit about what you will deliver and when, and honor refunds if you miss the promise.

If you were buying, would you trust a tight $35 trial with a next day deadline more than a traditional portfolio, and why?",moneymakingcow,3,1,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

1ncvshb,I finally started to make money!,"I flair it as success story but It’s hardly a success, I am just starting.
Since 2022 I had the idea of going into mapping suggestions for travellers (a market FULL of overpriced competition).
I launched my first map at the end of 2022 (Rome Food Guide, since I am from Rome, and made around 40$), other maps I tried making didn’t went any better.
Then I started travelling full time in 2024 and everything changed with social media, but I still lacked a solid product.
After an accident that happened to my wife we stopped travelling and went back into corporate job, meanwhile I realised the product I wanted to build: using data extraction to make travel maps and itineraries for EVERY country of the world. Reddit was my main source (this is why I am also full on RDDT stocks lol).
Now i reached the sweet spot where I sell under a membership for 3$ monthly to access my whole catalogue (about 300 products) and from there I leverage with consultation calls 30$/hour (well this is not exactly passive). This month stated with 200$ and I am very happy from the first reviews I am getting!
The downside is that I am off from social media (doing both a corporate job and a side hustle kills me, so currently I don’t have social energy to expose myself on camera.
The big trial will be next year, my wife and I decided to leave corporate job in December, she will go back to Japan while I will go 1 year from Italy to Japan by bicycle to promote the product.
Hopefully it will go well, I am starting to be very positive about it.

What I learned?
- Try the product for yourself first, if you need it perhaps other people will need it as well
- Social media does 80% of the job, if the product is great but no one knows it it’s meaningless
- Be patient, it took me three years of efforts to start making little money, so I need to be patient about future results and believe in what I do.

Good luck everyone ✌🏻

1ncslh3,"Lessons from trying to build passive income with mobile apps (4 years, 3 apps, lots of mistakes)","I’ve been experimenting with creating mobile apps for about four years now – partly out of personal interest, partly with the hope of building a small stream of passive income.

It started with **Simple Stepper**, a minimalist step counter app for Android. At first, it was just a test project to learn the full cycle of app development (coding, testing, publishing, marketing). To my surprise, it grew to about 500 active users over about half a year. Not life-changing, but enough to show some potential.

Encouraged, I launched other apps:

* **War Grids**, a mobile strategy game (Android & iOS). Fun to build, but nearly invisible in the stores – I spent more on ads than I’ll ever make back.
* **Simple Diet Coach**, an unfinished app that aimed to auto-generate meal plans.
* **Simple Date Opener**, which had some initial buzz but ran into privacy concerns.

After all that, the ironic result: my very first test app (Simple Stepper) is still the only one generating consistent monthly income. It’s far from enough to live on, but it’s “truly passive” in the sense that I haven’t touched it much in a year, and people still use it.

Some takeaways from this journey so far:

* The simplest ideas often perform better than the “cool” ones.
* Marketing is by far the hardest part. Ads drained money with almost no return.
* iOS users *might* spend more, but visibility is still the real bottleneck.
* Passive income with apps is possible, but it’s a long game – and usually slower than you expect.

I’d love to hear from others:

* Has anyone here successfully turned apps into a meaningful passive income stream?
* Did you rely on ads, subscriptions, or something else?
* And how do you decide whether to keep investing time/money in a project that’s only partly working?

1nco30f,How I started earning passive income with digital products,"I recently started creating simple digital products (like ebooks and guides).

1ncnrja,The 14 day client sprint that fills your pipeline,"If your calendar is empty, ship activity that compounds. A 14 day client sprint gives you two weeks of focused action and clear math. The goal is not viral posts. The goal is booked calls and paid trials.

**How the sprint works**

1. Build a 100 row sheet: 40 past or warm contacts, 40 lookalikes, 20 dream accounts. Add role, site, a likely pain, and contact method.
2. Do 3x3 research per lead: 3 facts in 3 minutes; write one personalized opener that proves you looked.
3. Send 10 messages per weekday with a 4 sentence script: compliment, one quick win you can deliver in 24 to 48 hours, one sentence of proof, yes or no ask for a 10 minute call.
4. Offer a low friction trial, like a $35 audit or a $45 micro implementation. Promise a same day or next day before and after.
5. Follow up twice: day 3 adds a new angle, day 7 soft closes the loop. Replace non responders so the list stays at 100.

**Tiny case study**  
I ran this for a simple copy refresh offer. Results in 10 working days: 98 messages sent, 21 replies, 12 calls, 7 paid trials at $45, 2 upgrades at $140, 1 monthly retainer at $180. Total collected in the sprint window: $775. Time spent: about 12 hours. Lesson learned: specificity and speed beat long portfolios.

**Pitfalls and quick fixes**

* Low replies: tighten your quick win to something you can do in 24 hours and name the deliverable.
* Ghosted after yes: send a calendar link with two times and offer a 10 minute phone option.
* Trials that do not upgrade: show a visual before and after and include one suggestion you will only implement if they upgrade.

**Simple tracker columns**

* Company, contact, opener line, last touch date, status, next action, notes, price.

**Follow up scripts**

* Day 3: ""Spotted X on your page and drafted a 3 line fix. Want me to send it?""
* Day 7: ""Closing the loop on the quick win. Should I archive this or schedule a 10 minute chat?""

Why this works: tiny asks get fast yeses, before and after screenshots do the selling, and a fixed price removes decision fatigue. Two weeks is short enough to start and long enough to show real numbers.

Here’s a clear roadmap:\nNiche Focus & Audience Understanding\nPick a profitable niche with a hungry audience. AI tools can help you analyze trends, identify gaps, and even generate content ideas that your readers are searching for.\nContent Strategy & SEO\n\nConsistently publish high-value, targeted content. SEO is still king for passive traffic. AI can accelerate content creation but make sure it’s human-friendly and actionable.\n\nMonetization Methods\n\nAffiliate Marketing: Recommend products your audience needs and earn commissions.\nDigital Products: Ebooks, templates, mini-courses once created, they sell 24/7.\nAd Revenue: Google AdSense or ad networks like Mediavine.\n\nLeverage AI Smartly\n\nAI can automate content creation, headline optimization, and even suggest affiliate products but the real money comes from your strategy and promotion, not just writing articles.\nConsistency & Funnel Building\nTo hit $1k/month, think beyond posts: capture emails, create mini funnels, offer products or recommendations. Traffic + funnel = passive income.', 'My Website: [earngears.com](https://earngears.com)', ""There's massive income, and then there's passive income. And then there's massive passive income."", 'Do vlog', 'Try Listybox. Its a basic PoD system, this is what you need for passive income!', ""Blogging is NOT passive...at all. Even if your old posts rank for something for awhile it will eventually die if you don't refresh the old content and post new articles, so you always have to be actively promoting it, like you're doing right now by linking to it. It never ends."", ""Focus on E-mail Marketing and traffic generation. I know a program to help you get started. Doesn't take that much to start"", ""Yes, you can absolutely make passive income from blogging in 2025, but the strategy matters more than ever. Most blogs don’t fail because of bad topics or SEO, they fail because the content doesn’t connect, convert, or keep people coming back. That’s why the most important skill you can develop right now is learning how to create persuasive content.\n\nWhen your content actually speaks to your reader, solves a specific problem, and builds trust, you can monetize almost any traffic source. It’s not just about writing articles, it’s about writing content that leads somewhere, whether that is affiliate clicks, product sales, or email signups.\n\nTo start earning $1,000 or more per month passively, here’s what to focus on:\n\nFirst, choose a niche where people are actively searching for solutions and spending money. Then create high-value posts around those topics, ideally optimized for keywords but written in a way that feels personal and useful.\n\nSecond, set up a simple email funnel using something like Beehiiv. Collect emails with a lead magnet or content upgrade and then build a list you can monetize over time through affiliate links, product launches, or partnerships.\n\nThird, look into digital products. If your blog niche allows, you can create templates, guides, or small toolkits using Canva and sell them on Gumroad. Promote them through your blog and email list. This adds a second income stream that’s entirely within your control.\n\nYou can also consider adding print on demand through Printful, or even dropshipping products that align with your niche. Use your blog traffic to drive sales without handling inventory.\n\nAs for AI, it's a tool, not a threat. Use it to help with outlines, rough drafts, or repurposing content across platforms, but always add your voice. That’s what keeps your content from blending in with the rest.\n\nIf you want to go deeper into how to create persuasive content, grow traffic, and turn your blog into a profitable asset, I go through all of it in my newsletter. Link’s in my bio."", 'blogging is still great! and I think it has a great opportunity, but, you have to blog something valuable, your experience, your tests, your thoughts. you can use AI to help write and polish, but you need to add something, if you just recreate content that is already there and AI can generate in seconds, then you need to rethink']"

1nc6qen,"I made $3,483 in revenue last month fixing ugly product pics for ecom stores with AI","Just sharing what actually worked for me in case it helps someone.

As you are probably aware that tons of shopify/etsy stores have meh photos (harsh shadows, messy bg, directly from supplier). I offered “studio-quality” glow-ups per SKU, fast + cheap. led with proof.

**how i did it (simple but boring work):**

**1) prospecting (2 paths):**

* **Paid, fast:** **StoreLeads** to find active Shopify stores. you can start on **Premium $75/mo**.
* **Free, slower:** instagram/tiktok. search hashtags like *#smallbusiness #shopifystore #etsyshopowner*, check profiles, DM. I also googled `site:myshopify.com ""collections""` and built a sheet.

**2) contacts:**

* **Emails:** **Hunter io** finder/verifier (free tier is ok; paid **starts \~$34/mo)**
* if no email, i used store contact forms or IG/Twitter DMs.

**3) the hook (visual first):**

* grabbed 1–2 of their live product pics (screenshots fine).
* ran through **CherryShot AI**(start with the **$9.99** plan) → spits out 6 studio-ish looks per SKU. clients honestly couldn’t tell it was AI, just looks clean/real like profesional product photography
* light crop/text in canva if needed.

**4) cold outreach:**

* I used **Instantly** to send 3–5 sentence emails with the **before/after pasted at the top**. growth plan is **$37/mo** (good starter), you might also need to buy and warm up domains
* subject was dumb-simple: *“quick idea for your photos”*.
* CTA: “want me to sample 3 more free? full catalog is **$5–$30 per SKU** (volume → cheaper).”

**5) booking + delivery:**

* **Calendly (free)** for quick calls, then deliver finals via Google Drive folders; pay by Stripe/PayPal.

**Heres the numbers I did**

* **About 500 stores** contacted (mix of email + DM)
* **44 replies** (\~9%)
* **13 quick calls**
* **7 clients**
* **\~430 SKUs delivered** total
* blended price ≈ **$8.1/SKU** → **\~$3,483** revenue

**costs last month** Close to $350 with all the tools mentioned above, net was about **$3100**

**pricing tiers i used (kept it obvious):**

* ≤10 SKUs: **$25/SKU**
* ≤20: **$20**
* ≤30: **$15**
* ≤50: **$12**
* ≤100: **$8–$10**
* 100+: **$6**
* 3 free samples on reply, 48–72h turnaround, 1 free revision/SKU.

**outbound scripts I used (rough, not perfect):**

*email #1*  
“hey {name} — saw {brand} and liked the {product}. i mocked a quick before/after on one of your pics (attached). if you want this look across the catalog i do **$5–$30 per SKU** (volume cheaper). want me to try 3 more free so you can compare? — {me}”

*IG/TT DM*  
“random but i did a glow-up on one of your product photos. wanna see? if you like it i can do the rest SKU.”

**stuff that moved the needle:**

* **lead with the pic**, not a wall of text.
* reply fast (mins, not days).
* niche sprints (did a “pet brands week”, then “jewelry week”) → better replies.

**stuff that flopped:**

* long emails, asking for calls before showing value, over-polishing images.

**time spent:** \~34–36 hrs total (list 8h, outreach 12h, samples 6h, delivery 8–10h). not passive, but repeatable.

**tool list (quick):** StoreLeads, Instagram/TikTok, Google Sheets; Hunter.io; CherryShot.ai; Canva; Instantly; Calendly; Google Drive; Stripe/PayPal. (prices above, as of this month)

Just leaving the playbook i wish i had. if you try it, start with **20 leads/day**, keep it human, don’t overthink.",Teraze0x,11,4,['Post a before / after example please']

Lately, I’ve been wondering how I can use these skills not only for freelancing but also to create **passive income**. I’ve seen people mention niche sites, digital product stores, membership websites, and even SaaS tools built on WordPress.

I’d really appreciate if anyone here is working on something that could use a WordPress website developer.",iftiar_hossain163,5,22,"['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**Please do due diligence on any crypto opportunity.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/passive_income) if you have any questions or concerns.*', 'You’re in a really strong position — WordPress is flexible enough to branch into several “semi-passive” plays. A few I’ve seen work:\n\n• Membership sites → package tutorials, resources, or even community access.\n\n• Digital product stores → themes, plugins, or niche templates you can sell repeatedly.\n\n• Niche content sites → build traffic → monetize with ads or affiliate links.\n\n• Client tools → lightweight SaaS or dashboards for a very specific audience.\n\nThe key is to create something once that can be sold or accessed multiple times. You can start small (like one template or mini-membership) and scale from there.\n\nCurious — have you ever tried creating a simple digital product before, or has all your work been client-based so far?', 'Package your skills into something scalable like selling pre built niche site templates, WordPress plugins, or a membership with done for you site setups.

If you want to know more just message me."", 'One great option is to create and sell digital products. You can build premium WordPress themes, Elementor templates, or niche-specific landing page packs. Sell them on platforms like Gumroad or Payhip. Once listed, these can continue to earn without needing your constant involvement.\n\nYou could also start a membership site using your own skills. Pick a niche you know or care about, set up a site with gated content, and charge a monthly fee. This works especially well if you have tutorials, resources, or tools to offer.\n\nAnother solid idea is building a niche blog or content site and monetizing it through affiliate marketing and display ads. Use your skills to make it fast and well-designed, then focus on writing high-quality, keyword-targeted content. Add a Beehiiv newsletter to collect emails and turn your visitors into a long-term audience you can monetize.\n\nPrint on demand and dropshipping are also worth exploring. You can use WordPress with WooCommerce to build your own storefront. Connect it to Printful for POD or link with suppliers for dropshipping. Promote with SEO and niche content, not paid ads.\n\nThe one skill that ties all this together is persuasive content. If you can create content that attracts traffic and moves people to take action, everything else becomes easier. Most people miss this and wonder why their projects don’t convert.\n\nIf you want help turning your WordPress skills into systems that actually generate income, I break it all down step by step in my newsletter.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. You can do a niche in the medical field if you would like. That’s what I have done! \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically.

At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for.

1nblhkk,How my friend and I hit $1k/month in the saturated AI art niche on Etsy,"Hey guys,

Just wanted to share a small win that might help anyone feeling stuck.

So my friend got into AI art a while back and wanted to try selling it on Etsy. We took one look at the main niche and... It's just completely flooded with the same t-shirts, mugs, and basic prints. We knew it would be a nightmare to even try to compete. So instead of fighting that crowd, we took a step back and asked a totally different question: Where else can we use this art?

I basically just started doomscrolling Etsy for a few days, looking for anything with a Bestseller tag. Eventually, I landed in the dnd world. Thing is, I've never played a single game in my life, but I could see that people were buying a ton of digital stuff for it.

And that's when it clicked. Most of the dnd listings are relly simple and not interesting But a few shops were selling really beautiful, artistic files and were also tagged as bestsellers. There was the gap

So, I watched some YouTube videos to figure out basic rules of dnd, and my friend spent a couple of weeks generating amazing fantasy art. I handled the boring stuff, keywords and making the listing look good.

We launched our first product and it started selling within a couple of days. Right now, that one listing brings in around $1k/month passively. And there's still tons of room to expand.

The lesson? Don’t compete head-on. Go deeper, not wider. That’s where the opportunities are",MagicPaperCraft,46,14,"['Great advice! Thank you', 'This is all to advertise your Discord server, right?

1nb5pyt,What do people without jobs do to get money?,"This has always been interesting to me, what people with no jobs do for money.

I think this list can be pretty vast. What I think it boils down is what you're interested in and your skillset, if you are successful.

Everything doesn't work great for everyone. 

Some people will excel in one thing and flop on another. 

Here are some of the **various side hustles, income streams, and businesses I've tried over the years and how much I've made from them.**

If you're looking for something on the side, maybe this will inspire you or give you ideas. Please share yours too.

# Website flipping

I literally just posted about this. I build, grow and sell websites. 

This is part-time, on the side. I've sold sites between $100 and $81K each. My last flip made me $26,500 and happened last month. **I've made over $100K.**

**Difficulty level**: low (beginner-friendly, no coding needed, you do need a computer)

**Startup costs:** low ($50)

# Digital products

This is sales. It's a business. Like any business, no guaranteed income. Some nickname this digital dropshipping. You can buy pre-made products to sell (like ebooks, guides, or digital courses) or make your own, or do both. 

The products I have sold range from $7 to $1,497. I include affiliate marketing in this, since it's pretty similar**. I've made over $100K.**

**Difficulty level:** low (beginner-friendly, requires consistency and there can be a learning curve, social media smarts needed)

**Startup costs**: low to moderate ($50 to $100+)

# Theme pages

You create a social media page (FB, X, TikTok, Instagram, etc.) around a specific theme and monetize it. 

**I made over $2,500 in the first 3 months** on my last theme page. It was on FB and grew from zero to 15K followers in that time.

Examples of themes:

* Dogs
* Desserts
* Cars
* Shopping

**Difficulty level:** low - also beginner friendly but, you need patience. It can take several weeks to several months to build up traction.

**Startup costs:** 0 (you just pick a theme and social channel and start posting, pick a monetization method and that's it - there are guides and ebooks about this, so if you invest to learn, the cost will be more)

# Etsy

This is a handmade marketplace. Make stuff and sell on the marketplace. The marketplace has a ton of visibility but, I personally think it's saturated unless you sell something unique. You still need to do marketing yourself. 

**I've made under $200 from this.** 

I tried 3 different times. It just didn't work for me, personally.

**Difficulty level:** low to moderate (you need to have skills to make stuff, like handpaintings, brownies, pottery, t-shirts, etc.). You also need to know marketing so you can promote your shop.

**Startup costs**: low (you will pay for etsy listings (under $1 each) and if you do paid ads, thats a cost, or if you buy supplies/materials for the handmade goods you products, those are costs)

# Paid Online Surveys

Sit on your phone, tablet or computer and fill out mind-numbing surveys. Super simple. Low-paying. 

You would earn less than a part-time income from this but, there are an ABUNDANCE of survey companies out there. 

For higher paying opportunities, go for panels. 

**I did three panels: one paid $100 and one paid $125. I've done one for $400 too,** that I happened to get in my inbox, for a bank.

**Difficulty level:** very low

**Startup costs:** 0

# Settlements

Go to FB groups or settlement apps on your phone and apply to ones that you qualify for. 

This is a mixed bag. Some are big, some are small. 

The biggest ones I got I did not apply for, **two for about $800 each.** I literally just got a surprise check in the mail.

I've heard of people getting as much as $12K from these. 

Many are going to be super tiny, like under a few bucks but, there are so many and it's easy money, just not consistent and you have to be patient because they take forever.

**Difficulty level:** very low (find them, apply, wait)

**Startup costs:** 0

# UGC (user-generated content)

You work with brands and get paid to create short-form content for them, like IG reels or TikTok videos. You don't need a social media account or any followers. Because you aren't posting on your page, you are just creating the content.

Beginners can earn $50 to $100 per video, though I see many brands lowball creators, starting at $20 to $30 range or even trying to pay per views.

Go to apps or websites and apply to opportunities. Or, you can pitch companies. 

**I made $2K/mo from a big finance company** and a bunch of other gigs. I do this and brand deals (same thing but you do post on your social page) ever month.

**Difficulty level:** low to moderate

**Startup costs:** 0

# That is all

I can keep going. But, this is already super long. If you want more, let me know and I will post in comments.

1nceu0u,How I Went From Software Developer to Making $15k/Month Helping Ticket Brokers,"This whole thing started back in 2021 while I was still working as a software developer. Been coding since I was 19, worked at the same company for 4 years making decent money but nothing crazy.

Started messing around with ticket reselling during covid when events started coming back. Had the tech background so I was naturally good at the bot/monitor side of things. Within a few months I was pulling an extra few thousand every month just flipping concert and sports tickets on the side while still working my day job.

Other people started noticing I was consistently hitting on drops they were missing. Friends asking for help, then friends of friends. I'd show them my setup, share some strategies. Word kept spreading.

By 2023 I realized I was spending more time helping other people make money with tickets than focusing on my own flips. That's when I decided to actually formalize it - quit the developer job and started building a proper community with tools and guidance.

Now I've got 500+ brokers in my group and I'm making around $15k per month from it. Wild part is most of these people are making their membership cost back in a single good flip. Some of my members are pulling $5-10k months themselves now.

Never thought something I started as a side hustle would turn into this. Still feels crazy that I'm making more helping people flip tickets than I ever did writing code.

Anyone else here have a side thing that ended up taking over their main income?",None,0,3,['“Helping people flip tickets” AKA ticket scalpers']
1nbulcp,Seeking Pratical Advice on Building a Great Online Business & Sustainable Wealth - From those who've done it,"Hello everyone,

I’m looking for genuine advice from people who have built real wealth through online business, not just short term income or side hustles, but long term, scalable, and sustainable wealth.

Rather than quick wins or get rich quick schems, tips or secrets, I want to understand:

1. What online business models or strategies have helped you build substantial wealth over time? (This is not so geared towards as to what you've done, but more so what you'd always do if you had to start from 0 again?)

2. How do you generate winning business ideas? Is it more about spotting opportunities or an iterative process of trial and error?

3. When solving problems or refining your approach, do you rely on clear solutions from the start or evolve your ideas?

4. If applicable, how did you go about dominating your industry or niche? What strategies or mindset helped you become a market leader?

5. What practical steps should someone take at the beginning to set them up for long term success and growth? (Not strictly for wealth building, but ""timeless"" principles of how you'd do it again, how would you approach it if starting from ground zero again)

6. Are there any common misconceptions or crucial lessons about building and scaling online wealth?

I’m fully committed to putting in the effort and learning the right approach to create an awesome business & lasting financial freedom.

Appreciate all thoughtful responses and guidance!

You can use Canva to design simple things like planners, trackers, templates, or tools, and sell them on platforms like Gumroad or Payhip. These platforms are free to start and allow you to get paid internationally, often through Payoneer if PayPal isn’t available to you.\n\nAnother option is print on demand. You can create basic designs for t-shirts, mugs, journals, or tote bags using Canva, and upload them to Printful. Then connect that to Etsy. Printful handles the production and shipping, and Etsy already has traffic, so you don’t need to run ads.\n\nYou can also try dropshipping through eBay. List products that are already in demand, and only buy them from your supplier after someone places an order. Since eBay brings in its own traffic, you don’t need to invest in marketing to get started.\n\nIf you enjoy writing or sharing your journey, you can start a free newsletter using Beehiiv.

1nbyjl0,"Pregnant with baby #2, looking for extra remote work opportunities","Hi everyone!

I’m currently pregnant with baby #2 and just started a full-time work-from-home position. The pay is a bit lower than I expected (especially since I have an MBA and several years of experience), but I took the role because it’s flexible, it’s with a startup, and the environment is honestly great.

We just found out that I’ll have two under two in January, and I’m grateful to already be in this job. At the same time, I’d love to add a part-time role on top, since my current job doesn’t require a ton of hours right now.

Yes, we do know how babies are made, and we’re overjoyed and excited. But realistically, it means cutting expenses and thinking carefully about income.

I’ve been applying to part-time and remote jobs on Indeed, but so far haven’t gotten any responses back. I’ll keep applying, but I’d really appreciate any advice, ideas, or personal experiences from anyone who’s been in a similar situation. To clarify, I’m only interested in actual work-from-home positions, not gig jobs like DoorDash or Uber.

Ideally, I’d like to bring in a little extra income before baby arrives and hopefully keep it going after. I just want to support my husband as much as I can and be able to put aside even a small emergency fund.
